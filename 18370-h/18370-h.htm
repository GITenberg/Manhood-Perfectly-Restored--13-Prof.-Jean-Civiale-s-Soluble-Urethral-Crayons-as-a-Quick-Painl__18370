It</span>
is with great pleasure that we send you a copy of this, the sixth
edition of our brochure on Sexual and Urinary Diseases. The success of
the Civialè Urethral Method, since its first introduction into America,
has been almost unparalleled in Medical History, and we feel that the
time has come for replacing the brief pamphlet containing a mere outline
of the method, with a work somewhat more full and exhaustive.</p>

<p>Aware of the number of worthless and oftentimes actually injurious
remedies that are being advertised and recommended for the cure of these
affections, and the bogus doctors and worthless firms that infest every
large city, we have endeavored to give inquiring patients every proof
and assurance of the efficacy of the Civialè Remedies, every facility
for investigating our methods, and proving, to their entire
satisfaction, both the medical ability of our Consulting Staff, and the
honor, honesty and fair dealing of the Agency. We court the fullest and
freest investigation, either by patients themselves or any friends of
theirs in this city, either of whom we shall be happy to see and satisfy
at any time, at our Consulting Rooms, Business Offices or
Manufactory.</p>

<p>Repeated trials in some of the most severe cases of Spermatorrhœa
and Impotency, in both France and America, have proven the Civialè
Remedies to be safe, speedy and most satisfactory in all their results,
and we feel justly proud of having in our hands so excellent and
efficient a means for the radical cure of so obstinate, serious and
often dangerous a disease. We take pride in having saved many a young
and promising life, in having often stayed the hand bent upon
self-destruction, and in having many times cheated the grave or the
insane asylum of its expected prey. Nor do we feel less proud in having
been able, in cases of not so serious, though often of a more
embarrassing nature, to restore to full Sexual Power and Vigor
<i>middle-aged and older men whose desire had out-lived their power</i>,
or who, through early abuse, had become so weakened

</span>
as to be totally Impotent, incapable of perpetuating their
species&mdash;ashamed, discomfited, and disappointed at being somewhat
less than a man.</p>

<p>As every case cured is the very best advertisement that we can have,
it is hardly necessary for us to say that we endeavor to exercise the
utmost care, skill and discretion in both diagnosing and treating these
cases, and assiduity and scientific accuracy in preparing and
compounding those remedies of which we are the fortunate possessors.
Indeed, we do everything in our power to make success an absolute
certainty.</p>

<p>A word in closing. Our <span class = "smallcaps">Staff of Consulting
Physicians</span> is composed of men selected with great care for their
special skill and attainments in this special branch of Medical Science.
These gentlemen are handsomely remunerated for their services, and take
a pride and interest in every case they treat.</p>

<p class = "bigger">Our physicians hold no pecuniary interest in the
Agency, and hence prescribe for each case solely on its merits, having
nothing to gain by selling less or more to any one under their care.
They see and treat each case solely and wholly from a medical
standpoint, and hence are never influenced by any pecuniary
considerations whatsoever. However great the reputation of our
physicians may be, we have, from the first organization of this
institution, taken and held the ground that the best interest of the
patient is best served by resolutely divorcing the Medical from the
Business Department.</p>

<h4>SPERMATORRHŒA&mdash;IMPOTENCY&mdash;STERILITY.</h4>

<p class = "subhead">
The Baneful Effects and Consequences of Masturbation, Marriage Excesses,
Venereal and Urinary Diseases on Boys and Men.</p>


<p>Could we read the heart of every man and boy we pass upon the street,
how few&mdash;how very few&mdash;there are that would not reveal
sickening pictures of lust, disease, melancholy and insanity.
Charnel-houses of sin and lust&mdash;sloughs of despond and
regret&mdash;excess of passion offset by lack of power&mdash;dread,
despair, hopelessness, shame and desperation, making a picture of misery
scarcely to be conceived by any but those unfortunate beings who in the
thoughtless, careless heyday of youth, or the reckless reliance on more
mature vigor, have weakened, emasculated and enslaved themselves by
indulgences and excesses that have borne fruit of misery, disease and
desperation in after years.</p>

<p>How little the youth who, in his ignorance of the terrible
consequences of his vice, steals away to the secrecy of his chamber or
his bed, leaving his happy, healthy and playful companions, in order
that he may let the hot waves of lust and passion run riot in his mind,
and dry up every spring of healthy thought and action&mdash;how little
does he think of the after-time of misery and exhaustion that he is
bringing upon himself&mdash;how little does he think that the vile demon
that he is raising up will, like the vampire, suck his very life-blood,
steal away his strength and life and vivacity, besmirch and weaken his
mind, take the strength from his muscles, the courage from his heart,
sap the very foundation of his existence, unsex and unnerve him, render
him feeble, wavering and imbecile, dog his footsteps to the very steps
of the altar, to curse and blacken and disappoint those joys of
parentage and marital right that should be his. The shadow deepens with
him as life advances, and follows him, bringing shame and misery and
despair at every step, until the poor victim, driven too far, sinks into
an early grave by disease or suicide, or is lost to the world and to all
joys and friends behind the doors of an insane asylum.</p>

<p>He died of no disease known to medical science. He simply faded
away&mdash;weaker, more nerveless and hopeless day by day; he faded away
until, almost before any one knew it, the grave yawned to receive him.
Poor, miserable, hopeless wreck&mdash;poor suicide, for his own sin and
crime were the real causes of his death.</p>

<p>How many such there are at the present day. We meet them on the
street, in business and at church. Our insane asylums are full of them.
We
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Our Treatment is Pleasant, Quick and Lasting.
</span>
find their wives unfaithful or unhappy; and their offspring&mdash;when
they are cursed with any&mdash;poor, miserable, weak fledgelings, with
aged, wasted faces, water on the brain, with rickets and softening of
the bones&mdash;idiots or imbeciles&mdash;dying early and scarcely
regretted even by the parent whose progeny they are, for every wail of
the little suffering voice pierced his heart and reminded him of his
lustful sin, and passionate, inexcusable indulgence that caused all this
misery.</p>

<p class = "smaller twoem">
“And the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children, even to
the third and fourth generations.”
</p>

<p>Alas, how true! how indisputable! The imperative Laws of Nature once
broken, the consequences are <i>inevitable</i>.</p>

<p>Of late years it has become the fashion amongst certain men to scoff
at this terrible vice of secret indulgence, and to claim that its evil
effects are overrated, are portrayed too vividly. Ask some poor
unfortunate whose confidence you may succeed in gaining, and listen to
the pitiful tale of lost health and vitality he will tell you. Mark well
the wasted hand, the putty-like skin, the black-ringed, lack-lustre
eyes, the heavy lip, the labored breath&mdash;read the consequences of
his sin and crime in his shame-faced way, his shambling gait, his
nerveless hands, his fluttering heart, his weakened muscles, and his
tottering memory and mind.</p>

<p>Must he needs lie dead at our feet before these skeptics can be
convinced? Is not such a state a living death? Must these men visit him
in the cell of the asylum, watch him as a raving maniac, gaze upon him
as a hopeless idiot or a driveling imbecile, before they will be
convinced? Such proof is at hand. Not an asylum in any country but has
its score of such; not an asylum record-book but chronicles the sad
histories of thousands of these poor, lost creatures&mdash;male and
female; not an asylum nurse or doctor but will sadly point out these
creatures to you, bereft of every trace of reason, all sense of shame,
still practicing the horrible vice that has driven every semblance of
humanity from their faces and the very light of reason from their
eyes.</p>

<p>True, every boy or man who practices this vice does not come to this
end. But who shall discriminate? There are thousands such, and who shall
say which it shall be, or at what moment it shall occur? Ah! happy,
rosy-cheeked boy, so gay and thoughtless now, so free from misery,
disease and care, beware! It may be your turn next. A little thoughtless
indulgence, the imitation of friend or companion, though apparently
harmless now, may blanch your rosy cheek, destroy your peace and
happiness of mind, and make a life-long, hopeless, suffering invalid of
you&mdash;may shut the door of all earthly enjoyment in your face, blast
your hopes, disease or destroy your offspring, alienate you from friends
and family, and cut off from all communion with your race, make you an
object of shame and disgust to your fellow-men, sink you into an early
grave or entomb you for life in the cold stony walls of a lunatic
asylum.</p>

<p>The day will come, erstwhile, when you will curse the parents who
reared you, the friends who surrounded you and the teachers and
ministers who taught you, for not warning you of the terrible nature of
this indulgence, so secretly common amongst boys and young men.</p>

<p>The day will come, when in the midst of your mental, moral and
physical agony, with weakened mind and exhausted body, physicians will
tell you that
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<span class = "headnote">
When you are Tired of being Humbugged or Experimented on, send to us.
</span>
masturbation is practically harmless, that its consequences are
exaggerated, and that your sufferings are mostly imaginary. Then will
you pity their ignorance and bemoan the fact that to such men must
sufferers in your terrible extremity apply without any feeling of being
understood, appreciated or sympathized with, and, far less, relieved or
cured.</p>

<p>Happy will you be then, if you can (with your vice and misery staring
you in the face and threatening you with some or all of its dire
consequences) direct your steps to those who not only can and will
sympathize with you, but who are able to aid you with proper remedies
and restoratives and set you safely on the way to health and happiness
again. For there <i>are</i> proper aids and remedies; there are hope and
happiness to be obtained if the affections growing out of this vice be
skillfully taken in hand in time. None but the hopeless sufferers who
have been lifted from the misery, shame and weakness of their
self-inflicted suffering know how much this world owes to the high
medical skill, exhaustive study, and persistent search for truth and
proper remedies of those two great Frenchmen, <b>Professors Claude
Lallemand</b> and <b>Jean Civiale</b>. The medical as well as civil
honors conferred upon them by their country and their medical brethren,
great as they were, could never half repay them for the good they
rendered thoughtless youth and suffering manhood by their special
discoveries. There can be no question but that the <b>Civiale Urethral
Crayons</b>, named thus after this great specialist, and endorsed by the
most eminent medical men of France (that country in which lust and
passion are peculiarly prevalent), are the most far-reaching and
reliable specifics for Generative, Sexual and Nervous diseases
known.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>CAUSES OF SPERMATORRHŒA AND IMPOTENCY.</h5>

<h6>SELF-ABUSE NOT THE ONLY CAUSE.</h6>

<p>Many years’ experience in the treatment of these debilitating
diseases has proven very surely that there are many causes besides
Self-Abuse (Self-Pollution, Secret Vice or Masturbation) for
Spermatorrhœa, Impotency and Debility or Lost Manhood. Self-Abuse is the
most common cause, and we therefore give it the most prominence. The
others we will name briefly in about the order of their frequency.</p>

<p><b>1. <u>MARRIAGE EXCESSES.</u></b>&mdash;A very common cause, more
often producing Impotency (loss of Sexual Desire or Power) and Sterility
(inability to beget offspring), than Spermatorrhœa (loss of vital fluid,
daily and nightly losses, losses in the urine, nervous prostration,
debility, insanity, paralysis, &amp;c. For full description of symptoms,
see pages 12-16). Sexual desire was given to mankind, like any other
power or appetite&mdash;to be enjoyed in reasonable moderation <i>and
for the purpose of insuring a continuance of our species by the birth of
offspring</i>. Many men abuse this power&mdash;abuse it inordinately,
shamefully&mdash;and suffer the consequences. This is especially true of
the newly married, and men advanced in years, who push their failing
powers too far. As a just retribution for the abuse of so important a
function, the Almighty deprives some of desire, some of power, some of
both.</p>

<p><b>2. <u>ONANISM.</u></b>&mdash;By many this is confused with
Masturbation or Self-Abuse. While like it in some respects and in many
of its consequences, it is still different. It is as hurtful to an adult
as abuse is to a young person.
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<span class = "headnote">
We Cure where a Cure is Possible.
</span>
God punished Onan for this sin, hence its name. Yet, despite this
terrible example so plainly set forth in the Old Testament, probably
one-half of the married men of the present day are pursuing it, and
hence so many Impotent and Powerless persons, seeking vainly amongst the
many cheap, quack remedies for something to re-invigorate and
re-vitalize them.</p>

<p>This is a terrible vice, terrible in its consequences, and however
hardy and robust the man, sooner or later his sexual powers must and
will succumb to the strain. Many men write us, saying that they never
masturbated, and yet are totally impotent and cannot understand why it
is. And yet they have been thus injuring themselves for years!</p>

<p>Sexual power and desire were given us for one purpose&mdash;the
perpetuation of our species, and whoso endeavors to avoid this, must
suffer. Many married couples do not want more children, from care,
poverty or other causes, and hence the extent to which this terrible
practice is indulged. It <i>must</i> be from ignorance, for were it
commonly known how injurious this practice is, <i>but few would dare
take the terrible risk</i>.</p>

<p>And yet the resulting weakness can be speedily cured if properly
treated. In no class of cases have the Civiale Remedies achieved greater
success than in these.</p>

<p><b>3. <u>ANYTHING DEBILITATING</u></b>&mdash;such as Overwork,
Confinement, Sedentary Occupations, Worry, Care, Excitement, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.&mdash;These are much more common causes of Sexual and Generative
Diseases than is generally supposed, and usually very obstinate and
difficult to treat, because the system is so run down that there is very
little stamina or vitality to rely upon. Clerks, business men, lawyers,
bankers, ministers and students are very subject to this form of
impaired vital and sexual power. Theological students are very prone to
it. Many do not have any idea as to what their real trouble is, and lose
much valuable time in doctoring for Dyspepsia, Consumption, Neurasthenia
and the like, when really their very life and vitality are oozing away
from them in their urine or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>4. <u>WOMEN’S (OR VENEREAL) DISEASES.</u></b>&mdash;Gonorrhœa
(clap), Gleet, Stricture, Injury to the Urine Canal from the rough use
of sounds, bougies, catheters, &amp;c., &amp;c. Any one or all of these,
by extending the inflammation backward to the seminal ducts and neck of
the bladder, may cause either Spermatorrhœa or Impotency. Indeed,
Stricture (often caused by Self-Abuse) is one of the most common causes
of these complaints. It was here that <b>Lallemand</b> and
<b>Civiale</b> found the key-note of the true treatment of these
diseases.</p>

<p><b>5. <u>VARICOCELE,</u></b> or a wormy, swollen or twisted state of
the veins in the bag, and of those that run down to the testicles, is a
very common cause of both Spermatorrhœa, Impotency and Debility. (For
full description of this very common and often unexpected disease, send
for our illustrated pamphlet on the subject, or see Chapter XI, page 44
of this book.) No man or boy with Varicocele, no matter how it was
produced, can be perfectly sound and strong in his Sexual Organs.</p>

<p><b>6. <u>UNDEVELOPED, WASTED OR MISSHAPEN PARTS.</u></b>&mdash;A
failure to have perfectly developed organs sometimes dates from birth,
but in most cases it is caused by self-abuse at a time when the person
is growing. In any case, Seminal weakness and Wasted or Misshapen Parts
go together

</span>
as both cause and effect, and the one, when found, will usually very
soon lead to the other. <i>Twisting or Curving</i> is one of the most
positive signs of previous inflammation, stricture and twisting or
distortion of the seminal ducts, and hence sterility or barrenness. In
such especially are the remarkable effects of the <b>Civiale
Treatment</b> the most noticeable. We can say with positiveness, and
prove it by case after case, that by no other method can such rapid and
perfect restoration of the organs to a natural and healthy state be
obtained as by this. Some of the very worst and apparently most hopeless
cases that we have had&mdash;cases that have gone from one physician to
another without the slightest improvement&mdash;have yielded effectually
to the <b>Civiale Remedies</b>. In some of them the persons thus
afflicted would have been totally unfitted for marriage had they failed
to find relief. Their children&mdash;healthy, happy and finely
developed&mdash;speak volumes for what our treatment has done for them.

<h4 class = "smallcaps">IMPOTENT OLD MEN&mdash;the sexual decay of
advancing age.</h4>

<p>We have thus far given briefly the most common causes of Seminal
Disease. There are a few that we have not mentioned: Blows on the Head,
Loins (Small of the Back), Testicles, &amp;c.; Weakness caused by
prolonged illness, fevers, &amp;c.; Malaria, Consumption, &amp;c.; the
abuse of Tobacco, Opium, Alcohol and Chloral, &amp;c., &amp;c.; but
these are less common and less important. There is one condition,
however, that we have only referred to incidentally, and that is the
failure of Sexual Power in men past middle age. No man (if he is
reasonably careful and does not abuse himself) should find his powers
decaying before he is seventy or eighty years of age. Mind, we do not
say "no man does," but no man "<i>should</i>," provided he is reasonably
careful.</p>

<p>But here comes the fact. Most men are <i>not</i> careful, and most
men <i>have</i> abused themselves at some period. Many believe and
stoutly maintain that they "never had emissions or seminal disease, and
it didn’t hurt them." But it did, and it is just now that they begin to
feel it. It is true they escaped the more acute and direful effects, but
it told on them in after years. There are many thousands to-day who are
just now feeling the effects of early vices, now almost forgotten. They
can be restored to <i>natural</i> power by proper treatment, but they
rarely are, because but few of them believe that early self-abuse or
later Onanism has anything to do with it. So they spend a fortune
almost&mdash;and uselessly too&mdash;on Stimulants, Nervines, Tonic and
the like, but still remain partly or wholly Impotent. Foolish men!</p>

<p>Surely this was not meant for waste. Surely the influence of its loss
upon the system, especially of a boy or young man (growing and not fully
developed), must be great, and it is. Many and many a young man thus
wastes away before the eyes of his friends from no other cause. Many a
one loses health and strength from this cause alone, yet does not know
it. How much better if all this false modesty, social hypocrisy, and
blundering medical dosing and drugging, without thorough examination and
full understanding, were wholly done away with, and the young men, and
old men too, were brought to understand two cardinal facts:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The immense devitalizing effects of even small continued
losses of vital fluid, and,</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The fact that many apparently strong and healthy, as well

<h4>THE FORMS, SYMPTOMS AND CONSEQUENCES</h4>

<p class = "subhead">
Of Masturbation, Spermatorrhœa, Nervous Exhaustion and Spinal
Irritability.</p>

<p>In no disease known to us are the symptoms precisely the same in
every case. They vary with the constitutional peculiarities of the
individual. Yet in nearly every case there are certain prominent or
leading symptoms (signs) that are rarely absent at <i>some</i> stage of
the disease. We give here the more noticeable ones at first laid down by
<b>Lallemand</b>, the great French physician, who first gave us the name
“Spermatorrhœa,” who first wrote upon this disease, who was the first to
discover the connection between the losses of semen and certain symptoms
here given, and who, too, was the great originator of that treatment so
successfully perfected by his successor, <b>Prof. Civiale</b>, and which
is now the <i>standard</i> treatment, recognized and adopted in all the
French hospitals.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>OBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS DUE TO MASTURBATION.</h5>

<p>First, as to the appearance and actions of the
<b>Masturbator</b>&mdash;he who is constantly and recklessly drawing
drafts of exhaustion and decay on the nervous energy and strength of his
coming manhood, and which are sure to bankrupt the most robust
health.</p>

<p>If there is a man to be pitied on this earth, it is he who is walking
about from day to day conscious of being guilty of ever having practiced
this vice. Mark the man who is addicted to it in no matter how light a
form; <i>his face tells the story of his sin</i>. See his <b>haggard
looks</b>, his <b>deep, sunken eyes</b>, which he throws only half-way
into the countenance of his friend. Note <i>the <b>blue</b> or <b>black
discolorations</b> under the <b>eye</b>; the <b>nervousness</b></i> to
get away from a crowd, and the extreme <i><b>girlishness</b> or
<b>backwardness</b> when <b>introduced</b> into the <b>company of
ladies</b>.</i></p>

<p>The victim of the most dangerous of all vices soon reaches a state
which, if not promptly relieved by the proper remedy, will end in
life-long misery or an early death.</p>

<p>Objectively considered, the masturbator is recognized by a marked
facial expression, by a characteristic mannerism, and by a peculiar
mental state.</p>

<p class = "headnote full">
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
We Cure where a Cure is Possible.
</p>

<p>
<u><b>THE FACE.</b></u>&mdash;<i>The <b>facial expression</b> consists
of a <b>pale</b> and <b>sallow tint</b> of the skin, unusual
<b>development</b> of <b>acne,&mdash;red pimples</b>,&mdash;especially
on the <b>forehead;</b> a <b>dark circle</b> around the <b>orbits;
dilated</b> and <b>sluggish pupils; lustreless eyes</b>, and an
<b>oblique line extending</b> from the <b>inner angle</b> of the <b>lids
transversely</b> across the <b>cheek</b> to the <b>lower margin</b> of
the <b>malar (<i>cheek</i>) bone.</b> The <b>face</b> has a <b>haggard,
troubled, furtive expression</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>THE MANNER.</b></u>&mdash;<i>The <b>manner</b> of the
<b>masturbator</b> is peculiar. He is <b>listless, shy, retiring</b>,
and <b>easily confused;</b> he <b>avoids society</b>, preferring
<b>solitude;</b> there is a want of <b>steadiness</b> and
<b>decision</b> in his <b>locomotion;</b> his inferior
<b>extremities</b> seem <b>deficient</b> in <b>power</b>, and all his
movements betray <b>a mind ill at ease</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<u><b>THE MIND.</b></u>&mdash;<i>His <b>mental operations</b> are
<b>confused;</b> his <b>speech is embarrassed, awkward</b>, and
<b>without directness</b>; his <b>memory</b> is <b>defective</b>, and he
is <b>absent-minded</b> and <b>given</b> to <b>reverie</b>. If the habit
has long existed, and been excessively frequent in repetition,
<b>epilepsy</b> may be produced; or <b>serious mental disorder</b>, as
<b>delusional insanity, dementia</b>, etc., may occur</i>.
</p>

<p>
<u><b>THE SEXUAL ORGANS.</b></u>&mdash;The state of the <b>genital
organs</b> varies with the length of time the habit has been indulged.
In some young subjects, there will be observed an <i><b>extraordinary
development</b> of the <b>organ</b></i>, owing to premature excitement;
but the disproportion is not maintained. Prof. Barthalow says: "With the
progress of the habit the organ becomes <i><b>small</b> and
<b>relaxed</b>, the <b>erections feeble</b>, the <b>corpora
cavernosa</b> either <b>waste away</b> or their <b>vessels</b> lose
their <b>tonicity</b>, whereby an apparent <b>shrinkage takes place</b>;
the <b>corpus spongiosum</b> and the <b>glands</b> also <b>shrink</b>,
so that the <b>prepuce</b> (fore-skin<ins class = "correction" title =
"no closing )"> </ins>appears <b>unnaturally elongated</b>. The
<b>testes</b> may <b>increase</b> in <b>size</b>, become <b>tender</b>
and <b>irritable</b></i>, or they may waste away to nothing but little
strings; the latter is the more usual result.
</p>

<p>
“<i><b>Pains</b> in the small of the <b>back</b>, a sense of
<b>weight</b> and <b>aching</b> in the <b>loins</b>, around the
<b>anus</b>, and in the <b>testes</b></i> is experienced. <i>The
<b>appetite is capricious</b>, the <b>digestion feeble</b></i>, and the
<i><b>bowels</b> are <b>constipated</b></i>, or constipation alternates
with diarrhœa.
</p>

<p>
“<i>The <b>mind</b> is <b>deficient</b> in <b>power</b> of
<b>attention</b>, the <b>imagination is constantly pervaded with vague
erotic dreams</b>, the <b>moral sense</b> is <b>blunted</b>, and the
<b>perceptions</b> are <b>dull</b> and <b>confused. Pains</b> in the
<b>head</b>, in the <b>occipital</b> and <b>frontal regions</b> (front
and back of head)</i>, and a sense of fullness, and in serious cases
<i>alarming <b>Vertigo</b> (dizziness and falling); <b>pains</b> in the
course of the <b>principal nerves</b>, and an extreme <b>nervous
susceptibility</b>, are experienced. The <b>organic nervous
system</b></i> manifests a functional disturbance in harmony with the
disorder of the nervous system of animal life. <i><b>Gastralgia</b> and
<b>abdominal pain</b> (pain in stomach and bowels)</i> and
<b>uneasiness</b> are in some cases very distressing symptoms.
</p>

<p>
“The distinctiveness of the foregoing symptoms will be determined by the
extent and duration of the habit, and by the constitutional
peculiarities of the patient. <b>The more highly developed the nervous
system, and the more it preponderates in activity over the muscular and
digestive systems, the more serious the effects.</b>

We hold out no False Hopes.
</p>

<h5 class = "marked">EFFECTS OF MASTURBATION ON THE MIND</h5>

<p>
“The most serious <b>mental effects</b> are produced by
<b>masturbation</b>. This vice, commenced at or before the period of
puberty, interferes seriously with the development of the brain and the
evolution of the mental faculties.
</p>

<p>
“That <b>spermatorrhœa</b> will produce in one class of cases <b>mental
disorders</b>, and not in another, indicates either that some
predisposition to these disorders existed, or that the habit of
<b>self-pollution</b> was merely an expression of <b>mental
alienation</b> (insanity). The <b>images</b> which pervade the minds of
boys possessed of the highly-developed nervous organization of
masturbators are those of <b>delusional insanity</b>.
</p>

<p>
“There is, however, a <b>cerebral</b> (brain) <b>phase</b> of
spermatorrhœa which may be separated from the two preceding classes. It
is characterized by <i><b>indistinctness of vision, dilatation</b> of
the <b>pupil, amblyopia</b> (near-sightedness), <b>diplopia</b> (double
sight); <b>diminution</b> in the <b>sensitiveness</b> of the <b>auditory
apparatus</b> (deafness); <b>feebleness</b> of <b>voice; mental
preoccupation, hebetude</b> of <b>mind, confusion</b> of <b>ideas</b>,
and a <b>profound melancholy</b>.</i>
</p>

<p>
“The termination of such cases is in <b>suicidal monomania, delusional
insanity</b>, <i>etc</i>. In that variety of the cerebral form in which
a decided predisposition must be admitted to exist, to disorder of the
intellectual faculties, there are found various forms of mental
alienation. The <b>chronic form</b> is the most common, which
corresponds to the <i><b>melancholia</b> of <b>Pinel</b>, or the
<b>lypemania</b> of <b>Esquirol</b></i>, terminating in <b>dementia</b>.
Several of the most characteristic cases which have happened under my
observation correspond to the <b>delusional insanity</b> of <b>Bucknill
and Tuke</b>.”&mdash;[Manual of Psychological Medicine, Phila. ed., p.
103.]</p>


<h5 class = "marked">INSANITY FROM SPERMATORRHŒA.</h5>

<p>Many writers are disposed to underrate the importance of this
tendency in spermatorrhœa. The statistics of any of our large insane
asylums will illustrate the influence of masturbation in the production
of insanity. Mr. Holmes Coote, in a discussion which followed Dr.
Drysdale’s paper on the “Medical Aspects of Prostitution,” read before
the Harveian Society of London, remarked that “he still entertained the
opinion that there were no worse evils appertaining to human weakness
than this. He had opportunities of witnessing the fact that among the
young there was no cause of insanity more common than indulging in
habits which he would not further particularize, but which were known to
result in the most complete bodily and mental
prostration.”&mdash;[British Medical Journal, Feb. 17, 1866.]</p>

<p>Dr. John P. Gray, the distinguished Superintendent of the State
Asylum at Utica, New York (Twenty-Fourth Annual Report, 1867), thus
speaks of the <b>influence of masturbation</b> in the production of
<b>insanity</b>: “The records of this institution show five hundred and
twenty-one cases admitted directly attributable to this vice, and I am
well convinced that the number is greatly understated.”</p>

<p>We might add confirmatory testimony from a variety of sources, but
the foregoing is sufficient for our purpose.</p>

many to be found in every hospital for the insane in this country.

"James McC&mdash;&mdash;, admitted to the Asylum ten days ago. Single,
clerk, born in N.Y. State. Was found on 6th Avenue surrounded by a crowd
who were attracted by his violent and frantic efforts to destroy
everything within his reach. On being arrested and taken to the 29th
Precinct Station House, he was recognized by the Sergeant on duty at the
desk as having been arrested twice before within a week&mdash;once for
violent shouting and disturbance in the street, and once for an attempt
at suicide by drowning. As he had attempted his life by hanging the last
time he was locked up, and had afterwards seriously injured himself by
trying to dash his brains out, he was adjudged insane, and a watch set
on him all night. In the morning, when taken before the magistrate, he
was violent and abusive, using the most frightfully obscene and profane
language. There he was held for examination and sent to Bellevue in a
“straight-jacket,” which was found to be necessary in order to control
him. From the padded cell there he was sent here.<!--closed by table-->

</span>

<p>"Upon examination he is found to be suffering from acute mania,
alternating with periods of intense melancholia in which he invariably
attempts to take his own life. His language when excited exceeds in
obscenity anything ever heard. During the intervals of quiet he is
constantly practicing the vile habit which has undoubtedly been the
cause of his insanity. He has lost all sense of shame and continues to
practice before visitors, attendants and physicians. He makes no effort
to go to the water-closet, and his clothes and cell are in a filthy and
disgusting state. Ever since admission he has refused all food, and it
has been necessary to feed him with a stomach pump. He is losing flesh
and strength every day, and is fast wasting away.</p>

<p>"From his relatives who have twice called to see him it was learned
that his mental trouble came on very suddenly, although his memory and
faculties have been failing for some time past. They say that he
complained of sleeplessness, numbness and tingling sensations in the
arms and legs, headache, and a peculiar itching of the skin, for months
before any distinct symptoms of insanity appeared. They attribute it all
to self-abuse, which he has admitted practicing from an early age.</p>

<p>Spermatorrhœa may be conveniently divided into three stages.</p>


<h5 class = "boldf"><u>FIRST STAGE</u>&mdash;<u>IRRITATION,
CONGESTION.</u></h5>

<p>In this stage the sexual organs of the brain and nervous system first
begin to feel the strain of early abuse, overwork, confinement, sexual
excess, or whatever the cause may be in this particular case.</p>

<p>The Prostate Gland (<i>j</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>Fig. 5</i>) the Seminal
Vesicles (<i>l</i>, <i>Fig. 5</i>), Cowper’s Duct (<i>n</i>, <i>Fig.
5</i>), the Testicles and Spermatic Cord (<i>h</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>k</i>,
<i>Fig. 5</i>), indeed all the sexual apparatus, including the bulbous
sympathetic nerves lying just inside the spine, from the small of the
back down to the end of the organ, become filled with dark, thick and
stagnated blood. The Prostate Gland swells and becomes enlarged, the
Seminal Vesicles become weak, baggy and filled with a thin, glairy fluid
that oozes out into the urine and urine canal on any little strain,
exertion or excitement; especially when, after being in the presence of
the opposite sex, weak, feeble erections follow. The testicles become
flabby and stringy and no longer make strong, healthy, fecund vital
fluid. The constant calls upon them has exhausted them as also the
nerves that gave them life, strength and vitality. A heavy dragging

<b>weight</b> is often felt in the <b>groin</b>, especially after
walking or long standing. There is a feeling of <b>weakness</b> and
<b>exhaustion</b> in the parts. Often <b>strange sensations</b> shoot
through the parts, and they are <b>cold</b> and <b>clammy</b> at one
time, while <b>weak</b> and <b>sweating profusely</b> at another.</p>

by the <b>vital fluid</b> from the <b>Testicle</b> (where it is made) to
the Seminal Vesicles (where it is stored). The penis is shown cut off at
dotted line <i>g</i>.<br>
As shown here the <b>vital fluid</b> secreted in the minute tubules of
the healthy testicle is gathered into the vas deferens or conveying tube
<i>k</i>, which passing through the groin dips behind the bladder
<i>a</i> and empties into the Seminal Vesicles or Storehouse <i>b</i>.
From here it is thrown forcibly into the urethra (urine canal) <i>e</i>,
when needed, and expelled anteriorly by the ejaculatory muscles of the
urethra. To reach the urethra the Seminal Duct <i>m</i> passes directly
through the body of the Prostate Gland <i>j</i>-<i>b</i>. Upon the
outside of the testicle, the tube or duct is found twisted and forming a
slight bunch, known as the epididymis, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>.<br>
It is here that the pressure of a <b>Varicocele</b> is first
felt&mdash;here that it succeeds <i>in cutting off the free upward flow
of vital fluid</i> by pressure on these soft branches of the duct,
causing <b>emissions</b> by varying and irregular pressure and
<b>Impotence</b> by constant pressure. When the <b>Varicocele</b>
becomes very large, it then destroys the delicate tubing or the testicle
itself.
</p>

<p>The general nervous system also feels the <b>strain</b> and
<b>drain</b>. <b>Memory and application</b>, <b>good judgment</b>,
<b>decision of character</b>, and <b>clear-sightedness</b> are not what
they were. <b>Headaches</b> are not uncommon. <b>Bashfulness and
trepidation</b>, especially in the presence of females, is the rule. The
person feels <b>clumsy</b>, <b>embarrassed</b> and <b>ill at ease</b>.
<b>Sleep</b> is sometimes poor, there are occasionally <b>terrible
dreams</b>, sometimes <b>lascivious ones</b> accompanied by
<b>emissions</b>, <b>drowsiness</b> and a tired, languid feeling in the
morning, and a <b>disinclination to rise</b> and go to work are certain
signs of <b>impending</b> nervous exhaustion.</p>

<h5 class = "marked">WEAKNESS AND WASTING OF THE ORGANS.</h5>

<p>
As a rule the <b>organs waste away</b> rapidly or become <b>curved,
twisted, or misshapen</b>. Oftentimes the testicles <b>dwindle away</b>
to almost nothing. <b>Settled gloom</b> and <b>melancholy</b> pervade
the mind, and <b>hallucinations</b>, <b>morbid fear</b>, <b>unnatural
lust</b>, <b>groundless jealousy</b> and a <b>morbid desire for
solitude</b> show themselves. Undoubtedly the list of promotive causes
is considerably augmented by maltreatment and the employment of
injudicious remedies. We should therefore suggest to all prudent persons
the wisdom and importance of consulting <i>competent authority</i> only.
Self-enervation in the first instance brings about that irritability
which evinces itself in <b>nocturnal discharges</b>, afterwards in
inappreciable but exhaustive <b>diurnal discharges</b>, and subsequently
in complete debility of the whole generative system. This seminal fluid,
such indeed as it is&mdash;weak, effete and devoid of all generative
power&mdash;is undoubtedly the fluid which the organs suffer to escape;
and to prevent further its flow, as well as to give a healthy tone to
the secretory and retentive vessels ought to form our first care.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5 class = "marked">COUGH, CONSUMPTION AND GENERAL DEBILITY AND
PROSTRATION.</h5>

<p>It is a curious pathological fact, that during the progress of
Spermatorrhœa, difficulty of breathing, cough, and tightness of the
chest, arising in many constitutions from the seminal disorder, have
sometimes been actually mistaken for pulmonary consumption. The cough is
often distressing, occasionally attended by an expectoration of an
offensive kind. There is no doubt that many have been maltreated for
consumption when Spermatorrhœa was the real malady. That the latter
leads to the former is certain enough, but the stages and connections of
the respective diseases have been grossly misunderstood by practitioners
who have not had sufficient personal acquaintance with the indications
of Spermatorrhœa.</p>

<p>Remember that these continued seminal discharges of an involuntary
character disorder every function of the animal economy, and it may be
added that while Spermatorrhœa produces so many ruinous effects peculiar
to itself, it aggravates and excites any other disease which may
co-exist with it.</p>

<p>
The <b>features</b> become <b>pale, emaciated and haggard</b>. The

<b>appetite capricious</b>, the <b>muscles weak</b>, the <b>urine
pale</b> and with <b>a heavy sediment of semen</b> that drains away in
it almost constantly. <b>Emissions</b> at night becoming more frequent
and copious&mdash;sometimes bloody&mdash;although the fluid secreted by
the wasted testicles is <b>scarcely stronger than water</b>. <b>Sexual
incapacity shows itself.</b> <b>Ejaculation</b> is either <b>too
quick</b> or else very <b>long delayed</b>. The <b>skin</b> becomes dry
and sallow, the <b>liver congested and sluggish</b>. <b>The heart beats
irregularly</b>, and any sudden sound, movement or fright sets it to
beating violently. <b>Shortness of breath</b> is complained of. <b>The
brain becomes weaker and more sluggish day by day.</b>

He generally loses flesh, and feels uneasiness in his stomach which
suffers from many of the symptoms accompanying dyspepsia. He is easily
startled; the slamming of a door, the firing of a cracker, the falling
of a book, a sudden touch, or even speaking to him unexpectedly, will
cause him to start. Cowardice is a sure consequence of Self-Abuse and
involuntary emissions. The appetite is irregular, often poor, sometimes
voracious; the bowels are also variable in their action. The prostatic
portion of the urethra is frequently irritable and sometimes is very
much <b>inflamed</b>; oftentimes there is a <b>thickening, a sponginess
or puffiness</b> of the parts immediately involving the ejaculatory
ducts. The mucous membrane of the vesiculæ seminales becomes inflamed
and thickened. The <b>testicles</b> and the <b>spermatic cord</b> are
oftentimes very tender and the seminal fluid is much thinner than
natural. Such a Patient has generally <b>dark spots under his eyes</b>,
<b>a sharp nose</b>, and often <b>flushes of hectic color</b> in his
cheeks, particularly when in the presence of company, and there is more
or less palpitation of the heart. In the second stage, as in the first,
the pollutions are diurnal and nocturnal; the latter are copious and
recur frequently. So insensible is the passage of semen that the patient
is usually astonished and horrified on waking to find himself and
<b>bedclothes saturated</b> with this fluid, which is easily absorbed by
the clothes, and rapidly dries up, because it has become thin, watery
and effete. In addition to this loss he is subject to one equally great

<b>defecating</b>. This also takes place without any consciousness on
his part, and his only knowledge of the fact is from the alarming
weakness he experiences after passing water or going to stool.
Distraction or absence of mind renders the judgment unfit for any
extensive enterprise.</p>

<p>The sexual powers are greatly weakened; the overtaxed organs refuse
to fulfill their legitimate task; their susceptibility and irritability
are so great that the power of retention is lost, and the seminal fluid
is discharged prematurely.</p>

<p>The generative organs are wasted and inactive, or so weakened as to
secrete but a ropy, thin and glairy fluid, having few or none of the
characteristics of Vital Fluid. Should the individual suffering this
way&mdash;and either careless or unfortunate enough to go
uncured&mdash;have offspring, they will assuredly be puny in body and
weakly in mind, and will lead a miserable existence through the neglect
and indiscretion of their parent.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5 class = "boldf"><u>THIRD STAGE.</u>&mdash;<u>STAGNATION AND
WASTING.</u></h5>

<p>This stage is an aggravation of the two preceding stages
combined.</p>

<p>The emissions are accompanied and followed by a disagreeable and
disgusting sensation of shame and misery. The mind is absorbed as much
as can be by the one idea of its wretched situation, and the sufferer is
haunted by the thought that his condition and its cause are known to the
whole world, and that he is pitied or scorned by every person he meets.
He is hypochondriacal, and fearful suggestions of self-destruction ever
and anon present themselves.</p>

<p>The power of mental concentration is entirely gone and the memory is
so feeble that the patient continually forgets what he begins to say.
The dimness of vision is continual and so great as to be a material
annoyance; the eyes are wandering or fixed upon the ground, seldom
venturing to meet the gaze of another. The <b>ringing in the ears</b>,
<b>pains in the head and over the eyes</b> are almost perpetual and
frequently accompanied by partial deafness. <b>The heart is the seat of
pain</b>, <b>fluttering</b> and <b>throbbing</b> with <b>violent and
long-continued palpitation</b>, his hands shake, his limbs tremble, his
knees are weak, so much so that at times it is almost impossible for him
to walk erect. He experiences an insatiable desire for sleep, and yet
upon retiring he lies awake for hours, tormented by his troubled
reflections, and at last falls into an uneasy slumber, of short
duration, disturbed by wretched dreams.</p>

<p><b>Hard, red pimples</b> frequently appear on the face, forehead and
body, <b>scaly patches</b> round the <b>ears, eyes, nose and lips</b>, a
<b>black or bluish semi-circle</b> shows itself under the <b>eyes</b>,
and there is a hollow mark from the corner of the eye in a slanting
direction under the cheekbone to the angle of the mouth, which tells its
tale. The <b>skin is livid and clammy</b> and the digestion is bad. The
patient is tormented with <b>flatulency</b>, which he cannot always
control and which he justly dreads, as it renders him an object of
<b>disgust</b> to all in his presence. The bowels are generally
<b>constipated</b>, obliging him to strain much at stool, thus
aggravating the irritation of the prostate gland vesiculæ seminales and
increasing the <b>seminal losses</b>.</p>

<p>
The bladder is irritable and will retain the urine but a short time; the
ureters and kidneys are also inflamed and in post-mortem examinations
are

</span>
sometimes found to contain <b>abscesses</b>; they are the seat of much
pain when pressure is made over the intervertebral spaces of the dorsal
and lumbar vertebræ or backbone. The vesiculæ seminales have <b>been
indurated</b> and can be felt to be <b>knotty</b> and <b>hard</b>. The
spinal marrow is very sensitive throughout its whole extent; the
cerebellum is the seat of a <b>dull</b> and <b>heavy pain</b>, and there
is a feeling of pressure upon the brain. Cerebral congestion now and
then occurs. This stage of the disease is frequently accompanied by
<b>Bronchitis</b> or a continued <b>Catarrh</b>, also by disease of the
<b>rectum</b> and all the <b>tissues near the generative organs</b>.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the functions of the nervous
system are completely deranged, indeed, <b>nervous twitchings</b> of the
<b>eyelids</b>, <b>head</b> and <b>limbs</b> are the consequences of
<b>Spermatorrhœa</b>. He is finally either hurried to a premature grave
by consumption, epilepsy or apoplexy; or insanity, taking the hopeless
form of dementia, has removed him from his home to the madhouse.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that of all the cases of incurable insanity, a
large majority are caused by Spermatorrhœa.</p>

<p>Many, owing to <b>sheer neglect</b> or to <b>false notions of
delicacy</b>, delay seeking for proper medical relief until they are
almost destroyed, and body and mind are nearly in ruins.</p>

<p>Pitiable the picture of one who has <b>reached</b> this stage of the
disease. The organs are still congested but <b>irritability</b> has
given away to <b>torpor</b> and <b>sluggishness</b>. Semen drains away
by day and night without provocation, these constant losses dragging the
person to the very <b>brink of the grave</b>, or <b>standing him</b>
within that <b>melancholy shade</b> where <b>suicide</b>,
<b>insanity</b> or <b>idiocy</b> almost certainly stares him in the
face. The organs are wasted almost totally away. All <b>strength</b>,
<b>vitality</b>, <b>erectile</b> and <b>procreative power</b> have left
them, and the victim is at last totally <b>impotent</b>. Of no use to
themselves, a curse to their <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original">freinds</ins>, a disgrace to society, they sink from
sight into an early grave or are lost to the world behind asylum doors.
It is a sad and terrible picture, but true&mdash;too true&mdash;to
life.</p>

<p>The tendency of Nature in most disorders is towards cure, but <b>here
it is towards deterioration</b>. There is no chance here of the evil
“wearing itself out” save in madness and death on the one hand, and on
the other by the salutary intervention of the most <b>vigorous</b>,
<b>cautious</b> and <b>enlightened treatment</b>, a treatment pursued in
the <b>full light</b> of the aids afforded by the great discoveries in
physiological science for which the present age is happily
distinguished. Fortunately for humanity, by the aid of Chemistry, as
well as Medical Science, it has been reserved for us to present to the
public the <b>Civiale Remedies</b>, which have proved themselves

There are cases where the effects of early abuse are neither so rapid

appearances, are strong and robust. They only complain of certain sexual
symptoms that trouble them. But let them beware. Appearances are very
deceitful. Let a

sudden fit of illness supervene and see how quickly these apparently
healthy men succumb and are swept away by it. Then, too, in many of
these cases, he who to-day may seem strong and healthy, with the
exception of his sexual weakness, may suddenly develop most grave
nervous symptoms, and in less than a month be beneath the sod or
hopelessly insane. Such cases have occurred, and one particular instance
even as we write presents itself to our mind. Poor fellow, he died a
raving maniac the very night he was to have been married to one of the
most charming young ladies in New Haven. And yet he thought he was
perfectly healthy. He only learned his true condition too late for human
aid.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5 class = "marked">HIDDEN SPERMATORRHŒA.</h5>

<p>In many cases the seminal ducts have become so weak and relaxed that
the fluid passes off involuntarily with the water and is not perceived;
also when straining at stool and when you have an erection. To test its
escape in the urine, pass off your water in a clear glass pint bottle
and let it stand twenty-four hours in a warm place; then hold up the
bottle between yourself and the light, and if you discover a sediment of
a <b>white, fleecy</b> nature, resembling cotton, in the bottom, you are
suffering from <b>hidden spermatorrhœa</b>, from which all your present
ailments come. Where this fluid passes off with the urine, it is just as
injurious to the system as full emissions, as it is a continual drain
day after day, as well as taking that part of the vitality which goes to
supply the brain and nerves. Many patients afflicted in this way will
notice, shortly after urinating, a <b>dull pain</b> in the forehead,
sometimes extending to the <b>eye-balls</b>, causing, as well, a feeling
of <b>general debility</b>, as if they had no strength or will to do
anything. If this weakness is allowed to go on unchecked, the mind will
become diseased, the eye-sight will be impaired, and the vital forces
consumed&mdash;thereby causing <b>partial and complete impotency</b>.
Should you desire greater certainty in testing, either send on a sample
of your urine, or test it with our powder.</p>

<p>The characteristic symptoms of partial impotency are: an imperfect
erection, or, if the erection is sufficiently vigorous, it is of too
short a duration, and the vital fluid is discharged prematurely.</p>

<p>The erector muscles become paralyzed, and the organ remains inactive
at the call of the will.</p>

<p>The person thus afflicted is greatly embarrassed and mortified at his
paralytic condition. That buoyancy of spirit is gone; the snap, vim and
vigor that once held sway has departed&mdash;and why? Because that great
motive power (amativeness) that gives the push and go-aheaditiveness is
checked, or rather, ceases to act.</p>

<h4>IMPOTENCY OR LOST POWER.</h4>

<p>Scarcely a day passes that we do not have some patient inquiring
<b>“What is Impotence?”</b>&mdash;<b>“Are Impotence and Spermatorrhœa
the same Disease?”</b></p>

<p>
<b>Impotency</b> (from the Latin words <i>im</i> [not] and <i>potens</i>
[to be able]<ins class = "correction" title = "close ) missing">
</ins>means a condition of the Sexual Organs in which a man is
not able to beget his species. It may be because he has lost his
erectile power (and this is how it is most commonly understood), or
because he has lost all desire, or lastly, because the <b>vital
fluid</b> has become so <b>weakened</b> and <b>degenerated</b> as to
have lost its <b>procreative power</b>.</p>

<p>Impotence is most common in men past middle age. It may come on as
<i>the second or third stage of Spermatorrhœa</i>, or it may develop
slowly or suddenly <i>without any symptoms of Spermatorrhœa</i>. It may
be accompanied by various <b>nervous</b> and <b>exhausting</b> symptoms,
or these may be <i>wholly absent</i>. If vital fluid is being lost, and
the Impotence is due to the weakness thus caused, <b>nervous
exhaustion</b> is sure to come sooner or later.</p>

<p>Impotence and Spermatorrhœa may exist together in the same
person.</p>

<p>Many impotent men have no other bad symptoms than simply this failure
of the <b>sexual organs</b> to respond when called upon. The trouble in
these cases usually lies in the erectile muscles, which are
<b>weakened</b> or <b>paralysed</b>, and in the <b>nervous bulbs</b> or
<b>ganglia</b>, that are blunted or exhausted.</p>

<p>A perfectly healthy man should be able to beget his species until he
is <b>at least</b> 80 years of age. Instances of such power at the age
of 97 are on record. In these days of <b>exhaustion</b>, <b>early
decay</b>, <b>excesses</b> and <b>abuse</b>, most men begin to lose
their power at or before 40. This is not right, and can <b>certainly</b>
be remedied by proper treatment.</p>

<h5>IMPOTENCY, COMPLICATED WITH BLADDER OR PROSTATE DISEASE.</h5>

<p>In such cases the Prostate Gland is usually congested, enlarged and
irritated, and needs prompt and thorough treatment. (See page 26.) The
tone of the nervous system is also lowered, even though it may not be
apparent to the individual himself. Hence, some good, strong, special,
general and sexual tonic, such as <b>Civiale’s Tonic Regulator</b> (see
page 30) is needed, as is shown by the rapid improvement that follows
its use, especially when combined with effective measures for
strengthening the <b>erectile muscles</b>, invigorating the <b>Sexual
Nerve Ganglia</b>, and reducing the <b>Prostatic congestion</b>. Some of
the most remarkable cases of the thorough cure of Impotence and
restoration to full sexual vigor that appear in the 53d Volume of the
French Hospital Reports, were in men <b>past 60 years of age</b>.</p>

<h5>IMPOTENCY AND WASTING OF THE ORGANS.</h5>

<p>In many of these cases of impotence (as well as of Spermatorrhœa) the
organs were either small and puny from birth or had wasted away as the
disease progressed&mdash;just as a paralyzed arm or leg will waste away
from want of use and exercise. Such cases, as also those where there is
twisting or curving of the organ, need thorough developmental treatment.
Such organs can be readily developed under proper treatment, just as the
breast or a limb may be developed and increased in <b>size, strength and
power</b> by the use of the proper treatment. Those who have not kept
pace with the advances of medical science abroad can scarcely realize
how great her strides have been. To-day it is easy (especially in
Sexual, Seminal and Urinary diseases) to do what ten years ago the
majority of physicians deemed impossible, and to <b>Lallemand</b> and
<b>Civialè</b> belong the highest meed of praise for their unremitting
labors in bringing this branch of medical science to its present state
of comparative perfection. As an illustration we can cite case after
case that has been sent us by physicians in good standing as utterly
beyond their skill, and we have returned their patients to them in a few
months’ time fully and <b>perfectly restored to sexual strength</b> and
<b>vigor</b> as they, themselves, were obliged to admit.</p>

<h5>IMPOTENCY AT ANY AGE IS CURABLE.</h5>

<p>Do not despair then, reader, if you are thus afflicted and have made
several trials and failed to find <b>health</b> and <b>vigor</b>. The
<b>Civiale Remedies</b>, while not infallible, have certainly done
wonders for many so-called “<b>hopeless cases</b>,” and we doubt not
that you, too, can be perfectly restored. Submit your conditions and
symptoms to our Board of Consulting Physicians, and at least get their
opinion upon it. Certain it is that these remedies, brought to light by
the eminent French savant, Professor in the greatest medical college in
France, and adopted and endorsed by all the large Parisian hospitals and
most eminent French physicians, <b>cannot possibly hurt you</b>, and
<b>more than likely will cure you</b>.</p>

<h4>BLADDER, KIDNEY, PROSTATIC AND URINARY DISEASES.</h4>

<p>Congestions, irritation and even inflammation of the Urinary Organs
often occur in men, either alone or as a complication of Seminal Disease
and Weakness. The Seminal Vesicles lie just behind the bladder, while
the Seminal Ducts pass through the body of the <b>Prostate Gland</b>,
and open into the urethra (or urine channel) upon its surface (see
Fig.&nbsp;5). Hence, any inflammation or congestion of this large
gland that lies at the root of the organ and neck of the bladder,
is almost certain to produce <b>Seminal Weakness</b>, <b>Losses</b>
and <b>Impotence</b>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that men past 50 years of age are often forced to
rise in the night once or oftener to make water. This, and the delay
that sometimes occurs before the stream will start, are usually due to
enlarged <b>Prostate Gland</b>&mdash;a common condition in men past 50.
Many and many a man at this age finds his <b>sexual power declining</b>
and cannot understand it&mdash;<b>Enlarged Prostate Gland</b>.</p>

<p>As the gland enlarges and becomes stiff and its tissues hardened and
brawny, it presses upon and deprives the Sexual Nerves of power and
sometimes paralyzes them, causing total Impotency. How
useless&mdash;worse than useless, even hurtful&mdash;are the usual
remedies. The Prostate Gland must be softened, cooled and <b>robbed</b>
of its <b>inflammation</b> before Anti-Impotency remedies can be of the
slightest service. And here it is where the great success of the
<b>Civiale Crayons</b> is best shown: <b>The Prostatic Crayons melt, run
down upon, soothe, quiet and allay the inflammatory and hardened
gland</b>, while the <b>Impotence Crayons</b> are <b>re-toning</b>,
<b>strengthening</b> and <b>re-vitalizing</b> the Sexual Nerves, and
strengthening the <b>erectile</b> and <b>ejaculatory</b> muscles.
Perfect cure and perfect restoration are possible if <b>proper</b> means
are <b>properly</b> applied.</p>

<p>Spermatorrhœa likewise is both caused and complicated by
<b>Prostatic</b> and <b>Urinary</b> inflammation. The Sexual Nerves are
involved and weakened in the same manner as in Impotency, while, in
addition the hardened substance of the Prostate Gland keeps the mouths
of the Seminal Ducts open, and the <b>vital fluid</b> runs away into the
<b>urethra</b> to be swept out with the urine, without let or hindrance.
Soon this loss tells, not only upon the brain and nerves and general
health, but upon the testicles where this fluid is made. So much is
wasted that these two glands, work as they may, cannot supply a
sufficiency of good, healthy fluid, and meet the difficulty by making a
thin, watery infertile fluid that would flow away even if the mouths of
the ducts were healthy. They do this at the cost of a terrible strain
upon the whole system&mdash;they strain and injure themselves and grow
<b>weak and flabby</b> and finally <b>wasted</b>&mdash;often rupture
small vessels in their substance, thus yielding <b>bloody or black
seminal fluid</b>.</p>

<p>The <u>CAUSES</u> of Prostatitis or Prostatorrhœa are many and
diverse. The most prominent are:</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Gonorrhœa or Gleet</b></u>, running backward and settling in the
gland or neck of the bladder;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Stricture</b></u>, deep in the canal, causing congestion and
inflammation;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Masturbation</b></u>, by keeping the gland excited, congested and
irritated, often causes it;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Exposure to cold and wet</b></u>, especially sitting on a cold
door-step or damp seat;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Blows and Injuries</b></u> of any kind;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Strong Injections</b></u>, and rough jabbing with steel sounds or
rough bougies;</p>

<p class = "inset">
<u><b>Eating Hot Condiments</b></u>, or too free indulgence in alcoholic
beverages.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>VARIOUS COMPLICATIONS.</h5>

<p>If the inflammation extends to the neck of the <b>bladder</b>, he has
an attack of <b>cystitis</b>. If it goes down along the seminal ducts,
it produces <b>swelled testicle</b>, <b>clogged duct</b>, <b>chronic
enlargement</b>, <b>cancer</b>, <b>cysts</b> and hopeless wasting of the
<b>testicles</b>. If it extends up the <b>ureters</b>, it causes
<b>Bright’s Disease</b>, <b>abscess</b> of the <b>kidneys</b>, or
<b>lumbar fistula</b>. If it runs forward along the urine canal, it
produces so-called <b>gleet</b>. If it settles in the <b>prostate
gland</b> and becomes chronic, it may cause <b>abscess of the gland</b>,
<b>retention of the urine</b>, and certainly either or both
<b>Spermatorrhœa</b> or <b>Impotency</b>.</p>

<p>It may thus be seen how exceedingly dangerous a disease this
<b>Prostatitis</b> is, and how very important it becomes to check it at
the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>
<u><b>SYMPTOMS.</b></u>&mdash;We have space for but the most prominent
and frequent ones: a <b>dull, aching, dragging</b> or <b>throbbing
pain</b> between the legs, made worse by <b>standing, walking,
jolting</b>, &amp;c., and sometimes relieved by hard pressure, or lying
down with one’s feet higher than their head; pain, burning or smarting
on passing urine; <b>twisting</b> of the stream; the oozing of a thin,
glairy fluid; <b>sticking</b> together of the lips of the mouth of the
urinal canal; <b>soreness, aching or tenderness</b> of one or both
<b>testicles</b>; dull pain or ache in <b>the small of the back</b> or
<b>buttocks</b>; <b>dizziness, sudden fits of exhaustion, convulsions,
coma and death</b>. A <b>microscopical examination</b> of the urine will
reveal the nature of the difficulty in a moment. There also will be
found evidences of great <b>nervous wear and tear, and seminal
losses</b>, more or less constant.</p>

<h4 class = "marked">GLEET AND STRICTURE AS A CAUSE OF SPERMATORRHŒA AND
IMPOTENCY.</h4>

<p>These two diseases are probably less understood than almost any other
equally common. It is safe to say that at least one man out of every ten
has,
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Our Crayons are Inserted without Pain.
</span>
has had, or will have one or both. Neglected gleet often causes
stricture; neglected or improperly treated stricture often causes and
keeps up a gleet.</p>

<p>Another set of statements, equally sweeping and based upon the best
of medical evidence, may be made, <i>i.e.</i>, more cases of gleet and
stricture are caused by Self-Abuse (masturbation, Onanism), and sexual
excesses than by gonorrhœa&mdash;formerly and ignorantly supposed to be
about the only cause.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the main cause of both Spermatorrhœa and Impotence is
Stricture (whether caused by self-abuse, gonorrhœa [clap], or any other
excess). It was this very important point that <b>Lallemand</b> guessed
at, and that <b>Civiale</b> definitely ascertained to be a
fact&mdash;proved it by examinations of both living and dead subjects,
and demonstrated it before the eyes of every member of the French
Academy of Medicine, the most learned body of medical men in the world.
Upon this discovery is based the now world-famed <b>Urethral Crayon
Treatment</b>. It cures&mdash;absolutely, thoroughly and
<b>Permanently</b> cures&mdash;because it is based on truth; because the
proper remedies are placed upon the very seat and fountain-head of the
disease; where quickly and thoroughly it stamps out the fire
(inflammation, from the Latin <i>in</i>, and <i>flamma</i>, to burn, to
be a-fire) and eradicates the cause, at the same time healing the
abrasions, releasing and invigorating the nerves, cleansing and
unclogging the ducts, strengthening the erectile muscles&mdash;in a word
restoring the whole Sexual Apparatus to its natural tone and strength;
not harshly or violently, but gently, kindly, soothingly. Indeed it is a
heavy debt of gratitude the sufferers from Sexual Disease and Weakness
owe to <b>Professor Jean Civiale</b>&mdash;greatest of all French
savants!!</p>

<h5>STRICTURE THE RESULT OF MASTURBATION,</h5>
<h6 class = "nospace">AND THE CAUSE OF WEAKNESS AND IMPOTENCE.</h6>

<p>In brief it may be stated that <b>Masturbation</b> in early life, and
sexual excesses at a later period, may, and do produce
<b>congestion</b>, <b>inflammation</b>, <b>spasm</b>, <b>ulceration</b>,
<b>granulations</b>, <b>ulcers</b>, and both <b>spasmodic and organic
strictures</b> of the urethra; that <b>Spermatorrhœa</b> and
<b>Impotence</b> are due to this condition, and that the only really
rational treatment is that which directly medicates and heals these
parts. This, <b>Civiale’s Soluble Urethral Crayons</b> do, better and
quicker than anything else. Prof. <span class =
"smallcaps">Gross</span>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag24" href =
"#note24">24</a> for instance, says: “Exclusive of these cases, my notes
show that 13 out of every 100 cases of stricture are due to Onanism;”
and <span class = "smallcaps">Otis</span><a class = "tag" name = "tag25"
href = "#note25">25</a> says: “9 per cent. of all cases are traceable to
that practice.” <span class = "smallcaps">Reeves, Henry Smith, Goulet,
Physic</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Leroy</span> give
masturbation as a cause of stricture. <span class =
"smallcaps">Black</span> states a like case leading to sexual
incapacity, as a result of the stricture. <span class =
"smallcaps">Wade</span> says: “In several instances of the kind,
<b>where there had been no sexual intercourse</b>, the strictures, which
were at the bulb, proved more than usually refractory from the extreme
morbid sensitiveness of the whole urethral canal.”</p>

<p>Gross goes on to say, that in at least eight out of every ten cases
of <b>Spermatorrhœa</b> or <b>Impotence</b>, stricture of the urethra is
the cause of the trouble, whether the stricture is due to gonorrhœa,
gleet, etc., or to <b>masturbation or excesses</b>.</p>

<h4>THE CIVIALE</h4>
<h5 class = "nospace">PERFECTED AND COMBINED TREATMENT.</h5>

<p>How senseless, then, to endeavor to cure such conditions with stomach
medicines. Still, the <span class = "smallcaps">Civiale</span> method
does not wholly discard them. They have their place and their purpose,
and served it well. It was his practice in many cases to use
<b>Nervines</b> and <b>Tonics</b>, as well as <b>Digestives</b> and
<b>Laxatives</b>, by the stomach, and with excellent results, for in
many of these cases the <b>digestion was poor</b>, the <b>liver
torpid</b>, the <b>bowels sluggish</b> and <b>constipated</b>, and
<b>filled with wind</b>, the <b>appetite capricious</b> and
<b>uneven</b>. <b>Crayons</b> in the urethra could not wholly cure these
symptoms, although they stopped the drain that originally caused them.
Combined with the <b>Tonic-Regulator</b>, the results were prompt and
satisfactory.</p>

<p>
<b>Many patients began to recuperate the moment the inflammation,
stricture, ulceration and accompanying losses of vital fluid were
stopped, and were soon in robust health again</b>. In others, however,
he found it best, <b>at the same time that he was healing the
diseased</b> urethra, to <b>clear and invigorate the debilitated nerves
and weary minds, to tone up the stomach and bowels, set the liver gently
working, start the kidneys</b> (nearly always congested), <b>and infuse
new life, strength and vigorous impulses into the whole system by means
of his Tonic-Regulator</b>, which is a pleasant and most efficacious
combination of <b>tonics</b>, <b>laxatives</b> (not purgatives), and
<b>deobstruents</b>. <b>Skin, kidneys, lungs, heart, mind, nerves,
stomach, liver and bowels, were all set to working right</b>. And, as a
consequence, aided by the urethral remedies, the <b>losses ceased</b>,
erectile power and <b>sexual vigor returned, the step became buoyant and
elastic, the mind clear, the memory retentive, the eyes clear and
bright, the lips and cheeks ruddy with healthful color; the whole
system, indeed, renovated, refreshed and re-invigorated.</b></p>

<h4>THE DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND FAILURES</h4>
<h6 class = "nospace">IN AND OF MARRIED LIFE.</h6>

<p>What more perfect or pleasing picture than that of happy married
life. Yet how little of it we see! How the newspapers dish up to us in
strong words the misery, despair, wretchedness, infidelity and deceit of
the divorce court. How it stares at us from the desolate fireside of
friend and acquaintance; is hinted at or suppressed by the records of
the Coroner’s office; leers at us from the sumptuous mansion of the
affluent; lurks in the humble cottage of the mechanic. How sad the
contrast between the home where nestle happiness, love, contentment,
offspring; and the abode of suspicion, deceit, infidelity or
barrenness.</p>

<p>And yet men and women are being married every day, every
hour&mdash;ay, every minute. Men and women incompatible physically,
mentally, morally&mdash;urged on by lust, cupidity, love; to escape
unhappy homes; to hide sad sins&mdash;for a thousand reasons, some good,
many bad&mdash;are constantly marrying.</p>

<p>A man selects a wife less carefully than he would a horse; a woman
yields herself, her life, her happiness, blindly, unreasoningly, to a
man of whom she knows nothing. A man better fitted for the hospital, the
infirmary, or the insane asylum, enters the bonds of wedlock with never
a thought of the consequences; with never a care as to whether he will
wreck his own life and happiness or that of the innocent girl he is
deceiving; with never a heed of the ill-starred, diseased, puny or
idiotic progeny his act may bring into being, a burden to the community,
a curse to himself and a constant reminder of the parent’s
foolhardiness&mdash;ay, even crime!</p>

<p>No man who is affected with any form of Sexual or Venereal Disease
should for a single instant even think of <b>marriage</b> until every
<b>trace</b> of his <b>weakness</b> or <b>disease</b> has disappeared.
In these days of medical advance in this special field, there is no
excuse for such action. There are few&mdash;very few&mdash;cases of
Seminal Weakness and Impotency that cannot now be cured. Of course, here
as elsewhere, there are traps and humbugs, quacks and charlatans, false
theories and empty moralizing; but there is also truth and knowledge,
hope and certainty for such as are sufficiently in earnest to search for
them. Prof. Civiale, by his indomitable perseverance, thorough study and
experiment, and final conclusions and discoveries, has placed the means
of a perfect restoration to full mental, bodily and sexual vigor within
the reach of all, and no man has any right now to enter either blindly
or wilfully into so sacred and important a relationship as marriage, and
to lower and stultify its ends by blighting the happiness of a fair
young wife, exhausting his own vitality in the vain attempt to have
offspring, or in having such as shall be a curse to him through
life.</p>

<p>There are those (let it be hoped they are really honest in their
ignorance) who look upon marriage as the only real cure for Seminal
Weaknesses. Even if it were a fact that the marital relations did
accomplish such a result (and they never do, as bear witness the
thousands who are to-day weak, exhausted, ex-sanguinated, unhappy,
nerveless, hopeless wrecks, who are cursing the ignorant pretenders who
gave this false&mdash;this fatal advice); even if such a
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Our Treatment is Pleasant, Quick and Lasting.
</span>
result was a certainty, what right has any man to besmirch and soil the
purity of a happy and innocent maiden for such a purpose? By what law of
humanity are woman’s hopes and happiness to be hazarded on so fragile a
basis, her bark of life to be launched into a pool of such sickening
bestiality? Such marriages bear and are bearing deadly fruit before our
eyes day by day, in infidelity, abandonment, suicide, insanity, crime
and prostitution&mdash;in disease and misery, even to the third and
fourth generation.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>A SPECIAL SET OF PRE-MARITAL (Before Marriage) REMEDIES.</h5>

<p>No more delicate or wonderful piece of mechanism, no more grandly
conceived and wonderfully perfected bit of God’s handicraft is to be
found than the Male and Female Sexual Organs. It is a wonder to those
who have made these parts (with their elastic vessels, cavernous
sinuses, network of nervous ganglia and fibrillæ, chain of lymphatics,
periodical ovulation, timed pubescence, and perfected, co-ordinate
functions) a study, that they stand abuse and excess so well; that the
fierce blasts of lust and passion that sear and scorch them and
well-nigh dry up their fountain springs of vitality and fecundity, do
not wholly destroy or hopelessly disarrange their delicate tissues and
functions.</p>

<p>The first few years of married life, even to a healthy man, are
fraught with dangers he knows nothing of. How much more then is the
sufferer from a present or even a former Seminal Weakness in danger.</p>

<p>No man, be he ever so healthy, ever so conscious of purity and
freedom from abuse, should enter the marital state without preparing for
the strain naturally to be expected. As the voice, skin, hair, manner
and morals of the youth change at the period of puberty (when the sexual
power is first developed&mdash;when he first becomes a man), so does the
system, mental and moral, change when he enters the bonds of matrimony.
If at puberty new diseases are prone to show themselves and old ones to
be outgrown, so at marriage a like change must be at least expected, and
he who blindly or thoughtlessly hazards a leap in the dark is foolish,
or rather foolhardy.</p>

<h4>THE CIVIALE URETHRAL TREATMENT.</h4>

<p class = "subhead">
For the Radical and Lasting Cure of all Diseases of the Sexual and
Urinary Organs. Its Mode of Operation, Application and Advantages.</p>

<p>The Civialè Treatment, by means of quickly melting <i>medicated</i>
Crayons that are <i>easily</i> and <i>painlessly</i> inserted into the
urethra (or urine channel), and thus melt and run down over the
irritated, inflamed or strictured parts, the congested Prostate Gland,
and into the orifices of the Seminal Ducts, is the most successful
treatment ever brought forward for these diseases, and it has met with
just appreciation, for it has performed radical cures in some of the
most serious and distressing cases. Some of the advantages may be
briefly summed up as follows:</p>

<p>
<u>1. It combines local and direct medication of the diseased parts of
the urethra, seminal ducts and vesicles, as well as of the Generative
Nerves, by means of Urethral Crayons, with judicious invigoration of the
general Digestive, Nervous, Mental and Circulatory Systems, by means of
Stomach Remedies, thus attacking the complaint from all sides.</u></p>

<p>
<u>2. The Civiale Urethral Crayons are easily introduced, melt rapidly,
medicate the entire canal, never give the slightest pain, never stain
the clothing, are rapid, pleasant and cleanly in their action, could be
used by a child without danger of injury, are perfectly soft and
flexible, and give uniform satisfaction.</u></p>

<p>
<u>3. They need be used but once, or, at the most, twice daily.</u></p>

<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<span class = "headnote">
We Offer Special Help to Impotent Men.
</span>

<p>
<u>4. The good results of the treatment are apparent within the first
five or ten days.</u></p>

<p>
<u>5. Their price is so reasonable as to place them within the reach of
all.</u></p>

<p>
<u>6. They may be used to cure gleet, stricture and prostatitis, when
complicating Spermatorrhœa or Impotence.</u></p>

<p>
<u>7. They never decompose or lose their strength.</u></p>

<p>
<u>8. They are absolutely free from minerals, mercurials, caustics or
irritants.</u></p>

<p>
<u>9. They will do precisely what and all that is claimed for
them.</u></p>

<p>
<b>Civiale’s</b> knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and pathology of
the Genito-Urinary (Sexual and Urinary) organs, especially fitted him to
study and investigate this subject. It did not take him long to perceive
that <b>Lallemand’s</b> idea that the deep urethra, where the seminal
ducts open into it, was the real seat of the disease in both
<b>Spermatorrhœa</b> and <b>Impotence</b>, was the true and correct one,
and therefore, that any plan of treatment, to be successful, must look
to allaying and healing the inflammation, congestion or ulceration of
the urethra at the neck of the bladder, and stopping the losses.</p>

<p>He reasoned that when the inflammation, irritation and spasm of these
parts, and of the seminal ducts, was relieved, the drain of the vital
fluid would cease, the dilated mouths of the ducts contract, the vital
fluid become thicker and healthier, the organs increase to natural size,
and the distressing nervous symptoms, oftentimes dangerous to life or
reason, cease to trouble the patient.</p>

Exact Size and Shape of a <b>Civiale Soluble Urethral
Crayon</b>.<br>(Inserted into canal of organ.)</span>
</p>

<p>These Crayons shown here are small, soft, smooth, perfectly flexible,
and dissolve as soon as they are pushed into the urethral canal, thus
bringing the remedies directly in contact with the ulcerated and eroded
parts, it even running down the ducts into the seminal vesicles
themselves.</p>

<p>The growth, vigor and future prosperity of every nation depend upon
the strength and energy of its young men, and if the places of the
robust and healthy are to be filled by effeminate, weakened, nervous and
physically drained youths, such as the terrible vice of masturbation is
yearly giving us, the results cannot be other than disastrous. The
advice, warning and guidance of parents and guardians must be looked to
for prevention; the method and remedies of <b>Lallemand</b> and
<b>Civiale</b> for a cure.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>A GUARANTEED ASSURANCE.</h5>

<p>There are some persons who, from having used various forms of
medicated bougies&mdash;having had sounds, catheters and bougies roughly
passed upon them by unskillful persons&mdash;or merely from an
indistinct belief, based upon hearsay or tradition, feel some hesitancy
about passing anything into the organ for fear that it may do harm,
cause pain, or give rise to stricture.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Strictest Privacy&mdash; Perfect Confidence&mdash; Certain Cure.
</span>

<p>The majority of these timid people have got this idea from hearing it
said that stricture and inflammation have often been caused by gonorrhœa
(clap) injections, and they therefore have the idea that anything put
into the urethra will do harm. There is not the slightest doubt but that
strong injections of nitrate of silver, zinc, copper, carbolic acid and
the like (of which these injections are usually made) have, in many
instances, caused severe inflammation and, eventually, stricture.</p>

<p>But that is no reason why proper and absolutely unirritating and
bland medicines, such as those in the <b>Civiale Crayons</b>, should do
this&mdash;and they don’t do it. Make up a strong injection of zinc,
copper, &amp;c., and take a swallow of it. It will burn and pain your
mouth and throat, make you hoarse, and for days afterward you will find
it painful to swallow. Put a troche or lozenge, properly medicated for
the purpose, into your mouth, and, instead of causing pain, irritation
and difficulty in swallowing, it will relieve these symptoms if they
exist, cool and calm the membrane, soothe the irritation, and give tone
and strength to the vocal chords.</p>

<p>
So it is with the <span class = "smallcaps">Civiale Soluble
Crayons</span>.</p>

<p>
<u>(1.) They are wholly unlike any caustic, metallic or irritating
injection.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(2.) They do not contain a grain of any mineral, caustic or irritant
of any kind.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(3.) Their ingredients are purely vegetable.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(4.) They soothe, calm and allay irritation, and give strength and
tone to the mucous membrane, Seminal Ducts, Generative Nerves and
Prostate Gland.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(5.) They do not cause stricture, but they cure it if it
exists.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(6.) Allow one to dissolve in the mouth, eye, ear, nose, or, in fact
anywhere. and they will be found to possess only soothing and healing
properties.</u></p>

<p>
<u>(7.) They can be inserted into the penis without the slightest
trouble, and, melting rapidly and easily, flow down in a bland,
soothing, healing and strength and life-giving stream, over the diseased
parts.</u></p>

<p>
These Crayons have been in constant use in Paris for the past 25 years,
and have never yet, and never will, cause the slightest pain or
irritation. Patients may rest assured, therefore, that in using these
standard French Remedies they are absolutely protected, and need not
feel the slightest degree of fear. Indeed, so well established is this
fact that we are willing to pay $1,000 (one thousand dollars) to any
person or persons who can cite a single instance when the Civiale
Crayons have ever done the slightest harm.</p>

<p>
<i>The disease is in the Urethra or Urine Channel, whether it be
Spermatorrhœ, Impotence, Prostatitis or gleet, and in order to effect a
lasting cure, the remedies must be applied directly to the diseased
membrane. In nine cases out of ten, Spasmodic Stricture already exists
and must be cured before the person can get well, and the only way to
cure it is to apply the medicines directly to&nbsp;it.</i></p>

<p>
<i>It would be as silly for a man with an ulcer on his leg, or a crushed
finger, to expect to cure it by taking drugs by the stomach and not
applying proper lotions and salves directly to it, as to try to cure
seminal disease or weakness

without going right to the spot, as can be done by the use of the
elegant and harmless Crayons of Civiale.</i></p>

<p>
It was by establishing the fact of local disease and a local remedy
clearly and distinctly, upon both physiological and pathological grounds
and data, that <b>Lallemand</b> and <b>Civiale</b> gained such
world-wide reputation. And it was the discovery of not only the proper
remedies, but an elegant and perfect means of applying them directly to
the very seat and root of the disease, that has made the Civiale Method
so justly famous, and has crowned its use with such undoubted success in
this country, even in cases where every other plan and agent had
failed.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>A REASONABLE AND HONEST GUARANTEE.</h5>

<p>We feel no hesitation whatever in guaranteeing a perfect and
permanent cure of Spermatorrhœa, Impotence, Debility, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
in any case wherein our Medical Director decides that a cure is possible
by any means, if the patient will use reasonable care and diligence in
pursuing the treatment, and this is not hard or tiresome; on the
contrary, it is easy, simple and direct.</p>

<p>We say “in any case wherein our Medical Director decides that a cure
is possible by any means,” and we say it with a purpose, for it is our
aim and desire, at all times, to be perfectly frank and honest with
those who consult us. There are cases that no remedy, be it ever so
good, can cure, and when such a one occurs in our practice, we endeavor
to show the patient his exact condition, and not (as is so often done)
try to persuade him to purchase remedies that we know will do him no
good, or, at least, be but an experiment. So, in consulting our
Physicians, you may be sure of at least an honest opinion, in exact
conformity with the facts in your case.</p>

obstinate milky discharge or oozing of from two to twelve years’
standing yielded painlessly and permanently to their use. Stricture,
too, even when organic, if not so far advanced as to interfere seriously
with urination, yielded kindly to this treatment, being gradually
dissolved and absorbed until, at last, the canal was left free and
clear, and all the symptoms of urinary irritation had disappeared.

<p>This Course may be used alone or in connection with any of the other

<h5 class = "marked">CIVIALE’S TONIC-REGULATOR.</h5>

<p>Civialé’s Tonic-Regulator is all that its name indicates and much
more besides. It is composed of Tonics, Nervines, Bitters, Laxatives,
Nerve Foods, Cholagogues (acting on the Liver), Diuretics and
Diaphoretics (remedies acting on the Kidneys and Skin and thereby
increasing their secretions and cleansing and purifying the Blood),
Digestives, etc., etc., etc. It will thus be seen that a more complete
and uniform General Tonic-Regulator could not be devised, for it acts
upon the Brain, Mind, Nervous System, Digestive Organs, Spleen and
Pancreas, the Bowels (keeping them in a healthy and regular manner
only&mdash;not purging or weakening), upon the Heart, Lungs, Skin, Blood
and Kidneys.</p>

<p>So skillfully is the combination made that no one ingredient
interferes with the other, but on the contrary each seems to vie with
the other in building up and renovating a shattered, weakened and
disordered system.</p>

<p>Bilious, soggy, sleepy men, with aching heads, foul breaths, bad
tasting mouths on rising, clogged secretions, sense of inability to
exertion, furred or yellow tongues, and the like, absolutely need the
Tonic-Regulator, and not Blue Mass or Anti-Bilious Pills. Weak, nervous,
spiritless, exhausted, debilitated, pale, ambitionless, easily tired,
prone to become short of breath and have pain in side on running, who
find it hard to get sleep, are restless, brood over their troubles, real
or imaginary, start at loud noises or sudden jars, perspire too easily,
flush too readily, are not rested by sleep, and who are neuralgic,
certainly need the Tonic-Regulator, and will find it rapid in action and
very pleasant in its results. Health, strength, vigor, rosy cheeks,
elastic step, cheery voice, zest and happiness, hope and ambition, hardy
flesh and good ruddy blood, made by a perfect digestion of strong foods,
will certainly follow, and as they come, all the old myths and phantoms,
the melancholy, dread and brooding will disappear like unhealthy nightly
vapors before the sun.</p>

bitterly, or later excesses from unbridled passions, have drained their
vitality, established a condition of sexual atony (<i>a</i>, without;

nervous systems, brains or minds, will find the very Vital Restorative
and Special Generative Tonic they need the most in Civiale’s
Tonic-Regulator.</p>

<p>It does not do one thing; it does many. While it throws open one door

secretions, blood impurities and waste products to escape. It not only
makes the blood purer and richer, but it strengthens the organ (the
heart) that pumps it everywhere throughout the system. It not only
builds up and rejuvenates the general system, but it brings vernal
strength and power to the weakened and debilitated organs.</p>

<p>It was here that Civiale made Common Sense and Medical Science join
hands. (<i>a</i>) With his Medicated Urethral Crayons he healed and
strengthened the organs of Generation by direct local application.
(<i>b</i>) While with the Tonic-Regulator he sent his powerful yet
harmless emissaries (Tonics, Digestives, Cholagogues, Nervines and Nerve
Foods, Laxatives, Diuretics, etc., etc.) into the system, by the
stomach, with the food, thus guaranteeing their entrance into the blood
which carried them to every nerve fibre and tissue and attacked the
disease on every side.</p>

<h5 class = "marked">DEVELOPMENTAL LOTION.</h5>

<p>As has already been stated, in some persons Seminal Disease and
Losses of Vital Fluid lead to a wasting away, shrinking or dwindling of
the Generative Organs. It exists in others from birth, and is in no way
connected with Seminal Disease. Whichever be the case, it is
nevertheless true that a wasted or deformed part of the body, be it arm,
leg or what not, cannot in this condition be expected to perform its
function in a natural, vigorous and healthy manner.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of ignorance upon this subject&mdash;ignorance
that interferes greatly with the full and proper treatment of cases of
Seminal weakness. Many sufferers from Seminal Disease and Impotence seem
to think that just as soon as the losses or emissions are stopped, or
erectile power returns, the parts will begin to grow and develop, and
soon be restored to natural size and proportions. This is not so. In
some few instances it does occur, but in the large majority it does
not.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary in these cases to take special measures to
fully and perfectly develop the defective parts, and it can only be done
by giving
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<span class = "headnote">
We offer Special Help to Impotent Men.
</span>
a new start to growth and circulation to the nervous and nutritive
centres of these parts. A breast, a limb, a hand, indeed any part of the
human body, especially in persons not past fifty years of age, can be
enlarged and developed, and so, too, can the sexual organs.</p>

<p><u>The Developmental Lotion</u> that has been in use for many years,
is a local application (viz., applied directly to the organs), and acts
by stimulating growth, circulation and nutrition. It is cleanly, easily
applied, rapid and satisfactory in its results, and we guarantee that it
will give uniform satisfaction in all cases where our Board of
Consulting Physicians recommend the case as favorable for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>It should be used in connection with the remedies for Impotency or

such cases are wonderful and the results very gratifying.</p>

<p>Varicocele (from the Greek, pronounced Var-i-ko-seal, accent on
either Var or seal) is a condition of bagging, bunching, bulging or
twisting of the veins in the scrotum (bag or testicle sac.) It is most
commonly found on the left side of the bag, but sometimes is to be seen
on both sides. Usually the scrotum is bulged out on the side and
sometimes hangs very low, so long and twisted are the veins. To the
touch the veins feel like a bunch of angle-worms. In some cases they can
be seen knotted and swollen through the thin skin of the bag.</p>

<h4>A HIDDEN DANGER.</h4>

<p>In cases of Varicocele of the Cord (one of the most dangerous of all
forms), the veins in the bag are not affected, the trouble being mostly
in the groin (in the canal through which the veins run), where the
swollen and knotted veins press upon and seriously injure the cord,
preventing the free flow of Vital Fluid, and thereby causing Impotence,
Wasting of the Testicles,
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Our Crayons are Inserted without Pain.
</span>
etc. A dull, heavy, aching or dragging pain in the groin, back or legs,
is about the only symptom.</p>

<p>The great danger of this form of Varicocele lies in the fact that
thousands of young men are going about to-day not knowing that they have
the disease; not knowing that a persistent evil is nestling in this
little canal, gnawing at their vitals, and slowly but surely undermining
and destroying their sexual vigor and manhood.</p>

<p>We know this to be so because we are daily being consulted by men of
different ages, who, until our physician, in the course of the
examination, showed it to them, <i>never suspected its existence</i>.
Many of these men had been “doctoring” for years for seminal weakness
and the like, with varying success, never being quite cured, or, if
cured, soon relapsing&mdash;all because a Varicocele of the Cord existed
unsuspected and therefore untreated.</p>

<p>CAUSES.&mdash;The causes of this condition of the veins of the bag
are very numerous. Some of the most important are Masturbation or
excess, causing weakening of all the parts, the veins included; Falls,
Blows, Strains, Excessive Horseback and Bicycle Riding, Running,
Jumping, Mumps going to the Testicles, Gonorrhœal Inflammation settling
there, Kick in the Groin, Wearing of Improper Trusses, etc., etc.
Masturbation is one of the most common of all the causes. In many
instances, even if it does not <i>directly</i> cause the complaint, it
weakens the parts, so that blows, strains, etc., that in others would
not produce any particular trouble, readily cause it in these
persons.</p>

<p>
SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The symptoms are not many unless it has caused seminal
weakness and lost vitality, in which case all the symptoms of these
complaints may really be attributed to the Varicocele. Pains in the
Groin, Limbs and Back; a sense of weight or dragging; Neuralgia of the
Testicles, Fetid Perspiration; Itching and peculiar sensations in the
Skin of the Bag; Chafing
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<span class = "headnote">
We Cure where a Cure is Possible.
</span>
in warm weather; easy tiring under rapid walking or running, are not
uncommon. In some very bad cases, however, none of these symptoms, or
only a few, are present. Why, we cannot say.</p>

<p>PROGNOSIS.&mdash;In itself this disease is not dangerous. It is from
the fact that the veins may go on bulging until an enormous swelling is
produced (we have seen cases where the bag hung as low as the knee and
was nearly as large around as a man’s arm); that the testicles may be
entirely wasted away, and that it may cause Spermatorrhœa, Lost Manhood,
Total Impotence, &amp;c., &amp;c., constitute its greatest gravity.</p>

<p>TREATMENT.&mdash;Cutting and tying operations are exceedingly
dangerous, having frequently caused death; and even if successful, the
testicles, having their blood supply thus entirely cut off, waste away,
and Impotence certainly results. Prof. Chevillot, the great French
surgeon, was assassinated by a patient, in whose case he tied the veins
on both sides for a double Varicocele. Becoming totally impotent, on the
very eve of his marriage with a beautiful and accomplished young lady,
this man became desperate and attempted the surgeon’s life.</p>

<p>To effect a cure, the following obstacles must be overcome:</p>

<p><i>Weakness and bulging of the walls of the veins.</i></p>

<p><i>Weakness and relaxation of the dartos muscle of the
scrotum.</i></p>

<p><i>Over-clogging and stagnation of blood in the veins.</i></p>

<p><i>Healing and strengthening of the ruptured and relaxed valves of
the veins.</i></p>

<p><i>Relief of the pressure and weight of the column of blood from
above.</i></p>

<p>Suspensory Bandages are good, because they act as supports.</p>

<p>Astringent and Tonic Washes are good, because they strengthen the
weakened veins and muscles and heal the relaxed valves.</p>

<p>Proper Trusses are good, because they break the great pressure of the
blood from above, and act as do the valves in the veins in the groin in
health. Also, because they act directly on the disease in cases of
Varicocele of the Cord.</p>

<p>But neither one alone will cure a really serious case of Varicocele.
Combine them, however, properly and scientifically, so that you have the
practical outcome of these three sound principles of cure in the one
appliance, and</p>

<h5>ANY CASE, NO MATTER HOW SEVERE OR HOW OLD, CAN BE PERMANENTLY AND
PAINLESSLY CURED.</h5>

<p>Such a perfect and practical combination is to be found in the
Elastic self-adjusting and adjustable Cradle and Compressor, which has
succeeded in curing many very serious and (apparently) hopeless cases.
Patented and thoroughly protected from all infringements and imitations
(and many would-be ones, seeing our success and recognizing the merits
of the Cradle-Compressor, have lately sprung up), both in this country
and Europe, there is nothing like it. It combines all the good points of
all previous instruments, and being easy to wear, rapid and pleasing in
its results, and certain in its effects, is the only rational means for
radically curing this disease.</p>

<p>Briefly: It consists of a very light and elastic triangle of tempered
steel bands, that rests on the front of the abdomen, and is held in
place by a soft
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<span class = "headnote">
We hold out no False Hopes.
</span>
silk-elastic waist-band. In each of the slanting arms of the triangle
are small holes that admit the central pivot of a bell-pad, having a
central spring, and so adjusted that it adapts itself to every movement
of the body without being misplaced. By means of a thumb-screw and the
perforations, it (the spring bell-pad) can be set at any point in the
groin, and can be changed from day to day and hour to hour.</p>

By means of pivotal joints at the angles, the appliance can be made to
fit any one perfectly; moreover, by means of the metallic shoulder
below, the arms can be thrown into any lateral variation of the groin
line.<!--closed by table-->

<p>We thus are able to obtain all the marked benefits of a truss without
any of its drawbacks; and that special disadvantage, steady and
wearisome pressure at one point, is wholly obviated. The whole appliance
is held in place below by means of perineal tubular rubber bands that
connect with the waist-belt behind.</p>

<p>Attached to the metallic shoulder below is the Elastic,
Glove-Fitting, Self-Adjusting Testicle-Cradle, by means of which not
only are the testicles perfectly supported and rested, but by the
sheet-rubber lining and the elastic tie bands, a constant, easy and
perfectly painless elastic pressure is kept up on the dilated and
sagging veins, which are thereby emptied of their unhealthy and
stagnated blood and allowed to regain their tone, strength and
contractility.</p>

<p>By means of the elastic bands it is easy to regulate the amount of
pressure, thereby constantly adapting it to the improvement that is
steadily taking place.</p>

<p>The compression is so uniform, yet so elastic, that it is absolutely
painless, and no motion of the body, however violent, can disarrange it.
This, and the fact that the blood can enter and leave the testicle with
perfect freedom, constitute some of its most marked advantages over the
Truss.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wearer always feels a sense of rest and relief while
wearing the Elastic Cradle-Compressor, and from the first day the
symptoms of weakness and impotence improve. Being made in different
sizes and shapes, and

While it compresses the Varicocele, forces out the blood, and allows the
veins a chance to regain their strength and proper size again, it simply
supports and keeps from injury the testicle, which at once begins to
grow larger. In addition to their curative value in Varicocele, they are
now being extensively used by the medical profession for the relief of
the pain and subduing of the inflammation of “swelled testicle;” also in
hydrocele and hæmatocele.<!--closed by table-->

<p>The reason why Varicocele has until within the past ten or fifteen
years received so little attention is owing to the fact that up to that
time this bagging or bulging of the spermatic veins was looked upon as
merely a local affection. No one seemed to be aware of the fact that its
effect in nine cases out of ten was to produce Seminal Weakness and Loss
of Sexual Power, etc. To-day no fact is so well recognized in medicine,
although probably not so well known outside of the profession.</p>

<p>Then, too, until very recently, physicians either carelessly
dismissed a patient with Varicocele with the advice to “get a suspensory
bandage and wear it; the thing don’t amount to anything;” or else, when
the patient became persistent in his demands for a cure, advised him
that the dangerous cutting or tying operations were the only means of
relief. But this is all changed now. Physicians have come to know
something about the disease, and means for both relief and cure are now
speedy and certain, and in no sense painful or dangerous.</p>

<p>It is for the purpose of stating in as plain and concise a manner as
possible all the more important facts relating to this disease, and
pointing out to such as are troubled with it, or have friends so
troubled, not only the proper manner of treatment, but also the danger
of delay, that this little treatise has been compiled. Many a man well
built and apparently healthy, yet totally bereft of manhood&mdash;in a
word Impotent&mdash;can trace his deplorable condition to a neglected
Varicocele.</p>

<p>Nor are these the only ones who need information upon the subject.
Thousands of young men are to-day being treated for seminal troubles who
will never be cured, because they are entirely ignorant of the existence
of a Varicocele of the Cord, that most insidious and dangerous of all
forms of Varicocele, or, if aware of it, do not understand the terrible
influence it has on their Sexual Powers, and how great and persistent a
stumbling-block it will be in the way of all treatment.</p>

<p>It is for the benefit of all such that this little essay is intended.

<h4>THE RELIABILITY OF THE CIVIALE REMEDIES,</h4>
<h5>AND THE BUSINESS STANDING AND PROBITY OF OUR AGENCY.</h5>

<p>In previous editions of this work, we made no attempt whatever to
point out to our readers either our reputation as a medical business
firm, or proofs of the efficacy or reliability of the remedies we
represent and prescribe, supposing that any person at all familiar with
the names and reputation of Professors Lallemand and Civiale, and the
honors bestowed upon the latter by the French government, would need no
such references, etc. We find, however, that there are but few men in
this country who are as familiar as they should be with the nature and
extent of Lallemand’s and Civiale’s medical labors, or indeed with
French Medical History at all. We, therefore, for the benefit of such,
have here transcribed extracts from that most reliable work,
<i>Appleton’s Cyclopedia</i> (copies of which may be found in many
families, and every town and city library), from which may be learned
the professional standing and reputation of these great men.</p>

<p>Furthermore: Of late years there have sprung up in various parts of
the country, physicians and firms who have made it a business to prey
upon foolish young men, who took everything that was sent to them for

and for their benefit we have drawn up here and submitted such proofs of
our probity, fair dealing and medical capacity, as well as of the
reliability of the Civiale Remedies, as will, we believe, carry
conviction of our truthfulness and probity to any honest man’s mind.</p>

<p>We have always been averse to parading before the eyes of the
careless, scoffing world the sufferings of the victims of abuse or
excess, even when by doing so we might profit largely by such a course.
We have a large number of letters from persons who have been cured by
this treatment constantly on file in our office, and any sufferer really
in earnest will be gladly given permission to examine them, should he so
desire. But we certainly shall not parade such letters, written to us in
the strictest confidence and secrecy, to every reader of a treatise of
this kind, especially when we give an abundance of equally as good proof
of another kind.</p>

ability with our corresponding and office patients in the past, we
certainly shall continue to do so in the future.</i></p>

<p>First, let us call your attention to two very recent and very
flattering extracts from editorial articles that appeared in newspapers
of known standing and reputation in the city of New York, both of which

<p>It is a well-recognized fact by writers upon longevity that the men
of the present day, both old and young, are less manly and vigorous,
less able to resist the attacks of acute disease, and not only less
likely to produce healthy and vigorous offspring, but in the majority of
instances producing a fewer number as well as a less vigorous and robust
progeny. The ratio of births to deaths has fallen off some 12 per cent.
in births in the past fifteen years. This fact, coupled with the equally
startling consideration that the mortality of infants has increased
about 11 per cent. in the past ten years, must needs fill the mind of a
lover of his kind with dismay and alarm. Although invested and thickly
hedged about by ideas of false modesty and pseudo-propriety, in reality
the whole fabric of national and individual prosperity, health, vigor
and enjoyment, as well as the very important perpetuation of our
species, depend upon perfectly strong, healthy and vigorous procreative
powers. As an oak cannot grow from a flower seed, neither can weak, puny
and debilitated parents give birth to strong, vigorous and mentally
sound and active progeny.</p>

<p>
The subject of Procreative Pathology deserves more careful and extended
study and observation than the majority of our physicians have
heretofore been inclined to give it. Most of them have let the more
numerous and oftentimes the more trivial cases daily coming under their
notice crowd this most serious matter from sight, and when applied to
for advice or treatment by sufferers from these disorders or debilities,
have either pooh-poohed it or have given some simple (or useless)
placebo, believing the trouble to be more imaginary than real. Is it any
wonder, then, that such patients have walked blindfold into the arms of
quacks and charlatans who profess the most tender interest in even their
minutest symptoms?</p>

<p>
We have been led to make the foregoing remarks by what we have just
finished reading in a very interesting and able work upon this subject
recently issued from the press of the Civialè Remedial Agency, of 174
Fulton street, this city. The subject matter of this book cannot fail to
interest every man, young or old, and must prove of special interest to
men just married, and to that large

</span>
class of middle-aged men who find to their surprise and chagrin that
while their bodily health is apparently excellent, their procreative
powers have prematurely declined.</p>

<p>
The fact of the establishment in this city of an original institution
under reputable business management, each department of which is
presided over by a physician of special skill and qualifications, is
something of which every citizen should feel proud. And to judge by the
class of patients who may be found in their elegant consulting-rooms,
and the very large amount of express and mail matter they are constantly
receiving, we believe that they are appreciated.</p>

<p>With our magnificent hospitals, second to none in the world, our
large medical colleges and dispensaries, and the establishment of so
large and excellent an institution as the Civialè Agency, the main
offices being now transferred from Paris to this city, New York may
justly claim to be the great medical centre of the United States, and
sooner or later of the world.</p>

<p>We maintain now, as we have always maintained, that the surest and
best way to drive quacks and humbugs from any branch of medicine, is to
have some of our very ablest and most honorable physicians make such a
branch their specialty, and such is the course now being pursued by the
Civialè Agency.</p>

<p>The very fact that it takes its name from and is engaged in
manufacturing and prescribing the remedies of France’s most illustrious
specialist, Prof. Jean Civialè, is by itself evidence enough of its
medical value and professional integrity. Our feelings upon these
matters, <i>i.e.</i>, the great importance of their bearing upon both
individual and national vigor and prosperity, the necessity for driving
from this field of practice those quacks and humbugs who entrap the
foolish and ignorant, those cheap and worthless remedies that flood the
drug market&mdash;our feelings upon these matters are, we repeat, very
strong; and hence, when we find an institution for the treatment of
these diseases conducted upon the highest moral, medical and business
principles by men of undoubted medical and business standing and
integrity, we feel that we cannot endorse them too heartily.</p>

<p>
The <i>Tribune and Farmer</i>, of New York city, in its current issue of
July 26th, 1884, says</p>

<h5>“AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE.”</h5>

<p>“The propriety of devoting editorial space to the subject-matter of
any medical advertisement that may appear in our columns may be doubted
by some, and indeed, were it not for our personal knowledge of the skill
and integrity of the Medical Director of the Civialè Remedial Agency of
New York (whose advertisements will be found elsewhere in this issue),
we should deem ourselves more than guilty were we to utter a word of
endorsement as to the efficacy of their system of treating that serious
class of diseases in men which has been generically termed Nervous
Debility, and which for so many years has been, and is at present, made
the stalking-horse for impudent swindlers, quacks and impostors to palm
off worthless and often injurious compounds on their suffering
fellow-men.</p>

<p>
“Let it be understood, then, that we know whereof we speak, and that our
object is simply to furnish those who are afflicted with such reliable
information as will enable them to determine the true character of their
disease, and the best means to be adopted for a cure.</p>

<p>
“The method of treating diseases of the Genito-Urinary organs by means
of the urethral canal is in the first place no new-fangled experiment,
but is identical with the system which has been employed for the past
fifteen years in the leading hospitals of France, and more especially in
Paris, as the standard treatment, and one that gives uniform
satisfaction; and in the history of medical science there are perhaps no
two physicians who have done more for the alleviation of human suffering
and the cure of Sexual and Seminal Diseases than those eminent French
Surgeons, Prof. Jean Civialè and Prof. Claude Lallemand, to whose joint
studies and endeavors this system owes its origin.</p>

<p>
“We believe, in fact, that this theory and practice of medicine is an
advance in the right direction, and we predicted, from its first
introduction in the United States some time ago, that the people would
readily see its truth and accept the wonderful benefits of its practice.
And the result has certainly borne out our prediction, for thousands of
sufferers from such ills as Impotence, Spermatorrhœa, Kidney, Liver and
Urinary troubles have been cured by these remedies.”</p>

<p>
<i>Dear Sirs:</i>&mdash;My course of treatment being almost all used, I
feel it my duty to state to you my present condition, and I can say
without hesitation that I am almost a new man, and I thank God that
improvement has been so thorough and rapid, may it be but lasting.
Sexual desire is now perfect, erections are perfect, emissions come at
the right time, oozing of vital fluid at stools and in the urine has
stopped, I rest well at night with the exception I shall state further
on, appetite is good and digestion almost perfect. I can now approach
the presence of the opposite sex with some satisfaction to myself;
ambition is returning, and in fact a whole new lease of life seems
suddenly to have been allotted to me. The varicocele has almost
disappeared. I cannot say enough in praise for this beautiful little
appliance, “the Cradle Compressor.” Now, if it were not for the urinary
disorder which still remains, I should call myself well; that this
remains, however, is no fault of the crayons, and could the Course No. 3
have reached me undamaged by heat, as did the Course No. 2, I have not
the least doubt I should now be well. The symptoms of this disorder,
still present, are dreams at night, not nervous ones as before, but
still unpleasant; mucous oozing after straining, also in the morning on
rising I find the lips of organ glued, and on forcing apart a drop of
this mucous fluid makes its appearance. I have no doubt whatever that
had crayons reached me perfectly, this disorder would have been
conquered same as the other. Now, in your little circular you guarantee
a cure “in all cases wherein your Medical Examiner decides a cure is
possible.” Now this certainly holds good in my case. Please let me know
what you are willing to do about the matter, for I certainly need
another course of No. 3 crayons, and if you would furnish them in place
of the ones destroyed in transit, I should consider your guarantee
fulfilled. The course you sent me last could not be used at all; they
were ten times worse than the first ones, and I only wasted them in
trying to use same. However, do not send any crayons till you hear from
me, and I think the weather cool enough, as they would only be wasted
again. Could you
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>

</span>
furnish me, and at what price, a suspensory, such as you would
recommend, if not, where could I get one? I think it advisable to wear
one after laying aside the Compressor, as I have to be on my feet all
the time.</p>

“<i>Dear Sir:</i>&mdash;My attention has been several times called to
your method of curing Varicocele of the Bag without any cutting or
tying, and I am now going to describe my case to you, and get your idea
whether you can cure me or not. I would have done this long ago if I
hadn’t been afraid of being humbugged, as I often have been by doctors
and men who said they could cure me right off without any pain or
trouble. But they all fooled me out of my money, and that’s all. But I’m
going to try once more, and please tell me if you think my case is too
bad for your Compress and Cradle.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty badly off I know, but it seems to me that this thing
ought to be able to be cured by some one. This is how mine was. Eight or
nine years ago I fell from the rigging of a schooner, and was laid up
for nearly sixteen weeks with a broken thigh. I also had both testicles
terribly sore and swollen, and it was a long time after my leg got well
before I was able to walk, the pain in the groin, testicles and small of
my back was so bad. Sometimes, even when I was sitting quiet, it would
cut me like the stab of a knife. The first I noticed of the Varicocele
was one day when I was taking a bath I saw there was a sort of bulging
there, and come to notice it closer, it felt just like a bunch of angle
worms all twisted together. I tried cold water to it and wore a
suspension bag for a long time, but it didn’t do much good. At first it
didn’t trouble me much in winter, but was bad in summer. Now it’s bad
all the time, and I don’t believe I could walk half a mile without I
wore a supporter.</p>

<p>“I have tried most everything I ever heard of, but it’s no use. Some
of the things helped me for a while, but they didn’t last, and now I’m
pretty well discouraged, for I don’t dare have it operated on; not so
much that I’m afraid of the pain, but because a young man I knew went to
a hospital in New York to be operated on, and died, because the veins
got inflamed from the cutting and tying.</p>

<p>“I am willing to pay any one a fair price for curing me, because as I
am now I can’t do a fair day’s work, and my testes are wasting away very
fast. But I don’t want any more humbugging, and if you treat me, you
have got to give me good proofs that you can do as you say.”</p>

the package all right, and when I got up yesterday morning, bathed as
the circular said, and put the Cradle and Compressor on me. I write to
tell you how pleased I am. I always felt sure some one would find a cure
for this thing, and believe I’ve got hold of the right thing at last,
though I’m not going to crow this time till I’m part way out of the
woods at least.</p>

<p>
“Any way, I’m satisfied so far. The appliance is just what it was
represented, and I find that it fits me to a t, and is the most easy and
comfortable thing I ever wore. I haven’t had a bit of pain since I put
it on yesterday morning, and I have done some hard work these two days,
purposely twisting and wrenching my body about to see if I would get it
out of place.</p>

ache and dragging pain in my groin and back. I shall want some of your

seems to be entirely well. The left side is a trifle larger than the
right, but the veins are not wormy as they used to be, and the blood
don’t stagnate in them any more. The dragging pain is all gone away, and
the small of my back hasn’t pained me for a long time. When I came to
see you in New York, your doctor told me I <ins class = "correction"

every bit of worminess was gone and the canal was free of swelled veins.
You can tell him that this is so now, and that the testicles aren’t

“Our doctor here, who told me I couldn’t be cured unless I had it
operated on, says it’s the most remarkable thing he ever saw. Those are

about having to get cut.</p>

“I am a thousand times grateful to you. You have made me a man again,
and I shall not forget it. I am ashamed to think how mean a letter I
wrote you last summer about humbugging and the like, but I apologize
now, and if you find any other people that don’t feel sure you can cure
them, send them this letter or get them to write to&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>
“I shall remember all you wrote in your last letter about not ‘presuming
too much on my improvement,’ and to be careful about jumping, straining
and lifting hard, and the like. The Crayons did their work just as well
as the Compress Instrument, and I never can tell you how grateful I am
to you. There’s several men I know here that are going to write you

acquaintance with every patient, and treat him as a valued friend; and,
whether you ever order or not, we shall be glad to hear from you and
know your conclusions on this subject. Of course, every letter is
sacredly private. No one reads these but the Manager, and even our old
and trusted medical advisers do not know the names of our
patients&mdash;only the numbers and descriptions of cases go into their
hands. As a further assurance we destroy letters, or return them to the
writers, whichever they prefer.</p>

<p>We solicit your influence with your friends, and will be ready to
reciprocate such favors. You will also be often doing such friends a
favor, for which they will always thank you.</p>

<p>We shall be particularly pleased to hear from men advanced in years,
who feel the necessity of counteracting growing weakness incident to
their age, and who know the worse than folly of resorting to pernicious
secret preparations, the effect of which is to give unnatural
stimulation for a brief time, to be followed by a dangerous, perhaps
fatal, reaction.</p>

<h5>TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.</h5>

<p>We make special terms on our instruments and treatment to physicians,
and cordially invite them to correspond with us. We will do all in our
power to serve the profession to their satisfaction. We have the benefit
of the best medical advice and facilities in certain lines not
attainable from any other source on the continent.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>GENERAL PRACTITIONERS AND FAMILY PHYSICIANS.</h5>

<p>We cannot refrain, before closing this chapter, from saying a word or
two about the incompetency of the large majority of “general
practitioners” and “family physicians,” and their evident carelessness,
and in some instances, even disgust, in the diagnosis and treatment of
this class of cases.</p>

<p>The readers of this may be among that class who think the “family
physician” the embodiment of medical wisdom, and that if he has failed
to cure the case or pooh-poohed it away, there is no hope. But no one
M.D., however learned, knows all about the ills of flesh. In this, as in
the legal and other learned professions, a man may practice a score of
years, and still know little or nothing about various peculiar cases,
because they don’t come under his notice; he has no opportunity to study
them practically, and little inducement to theorize. And the class of
cases we are now considering, it may surprise the sufferer to know, are
deemed by many “regular” physicians beneath their attention. The
physician’s calling is a noble one, and he justly takes a high ground
regarding his duties. We honor the scruples of our medical friends, but
we do not understand nor approve the spirit which leads them to meet
these cases with ridicule or evasive answers.</p>

<p>That they do thus meet this class of cases, and that their course is
censured by the most eminent of the profession, we have abundant
evidence.</p>

<p>One of the best known medical writers of England, F.&nbsp;B.
Courtnay, member of the Royal College of Surgeons, etc., says in one of
his works (“True and False Spermatorrhœa” pp. 20-21):</p>

<p>
“Again, some medical men<span class = "twoem"> * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *
&nbsp; * </span>affect to consider these cases ‘objectionable,’ and on
these grounds seek to avoid them. Others boldly declare, that as most of
such cases are the result of unnatural and immoral habits, the sufferers
are justly punished for their conduct, and are unworthy of the attention
and sympathy of any one.</p>

<p>
“Now I conceive this to be a monstrous fallacy; for surely it is
entirely beyond the scope of any medical man’s duty to sit in judgment
on the applicants for his professional services. According to my idea of
professional duty, every man is bound to do all in his power to afford
relief to every sufferer who seeks it at his hands, without question as
to the causes and nature of the malady.”</p>

<p>Speaking of one of his patients the same writer says:</p>

<p>
“He had consulted one of the most eminent members of the medical
profession; and this gentleman evidently listened to his narration of
his case with great impatience and indifference, and upon the conclusion
of his history handed him a prescription, saying: ‘There, take that for
six weeks, and if it does not do you any good, I don’t know what will.’
The interpretation the
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<span class = "headnote">
All our Doctors are Regular Graduates, and their Diplomas are Registered
in the Office of the County Clerk, City Hall, New York, as required by
Law.
</span>
patient put on his conduct and the remarks was, that he need not trouble
himself to call again.</p>

<p>
“Now, I have the pleasure of personally knowing the professional
gentleman here referred to, and during the last twenty years have been
in the constant habit of meeting him in consultation, and I am sure,
from my knowledge of him, that his behavior resulted from no intentional
unkindness on his part, but solely from the unfortunate feeling of
reluctance to attend to such cases, which, both from my own observations
and from information obtained from patients, I know to be entertained by
too many members of the profession.<span class = "twoem"> * &nbsp; *
&nbsp; * </span>I am well aware that patients of this class are often
most tedious in the narration of their cases; that the details they
conceive themselves bound to enter upon are most painful, not to say
disgusting, to hear; nevertheless we must, as in many other instances in
the discharge of our duties, submit with patience, taking the rough and
smooth with the same equanimity, and in the special cases in question,
we should endeavor to forget the patient’s vices in his woes.”</p>

<p>
Another distinguished physician writes:</p>

<p>
“I cannot disregard the appeals of unhappy and humiliated people. Men
have come to me who were ashamed to show their organs because of their
diminutiveness, and who practiced masturbation and lived in celibacy
rather than bear the humiliation of exposure of the parts. Nothing can
be more pitiable than such a condition.”</p>

<p>If these very moral and dainty practitioners, who, as Dr. Courtnay
says, affect to consider these cases “objectionable” and the sufferers
“unworthy of the attention or sympathy of any one”&mdash;if these
moralists could sit at our desk, and day after day, week after week,
read the affecting stories of enforced celibacy, shattered health,
broken family ties, the anguish of jealousy, despair, misanthropy, the
consciousness of physical, mental and moral inferiority begotten by this
sad condition&mdash;we think that then these gentlemen would agree with
us that medical science and philanthropy can have no higher object than
the saving of these wrecks.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>OUR PATIENTS’ LETTERS AND TESTIMONIALS.</h5>

<p>Our correspondents are candid&mdash;they cannot well afford to be
otherwise&mdash;and it is seldom we read one of their letters without
feeling all the interest in the writer that one can for an honest
suffering fellow being. We would not feel this interest did they not
evince an earnest desire to profit by their misfortunes. Our aid is not
sought by those wishing a brute’s power for excesses, for we hold out no
inducements to this class, but plainly tell them that they will
inevitably pay the penalty for abuse of nature’s laws. Nor are our
patrons among the vicious and imaginative youth, or the class termed
“greenhorns.” We confine our advertising almost wholly to the daily
press, thus reaching the most intelligent class of citizens only.</p>

<p>
We regret that, for obvious reasons, we cannot present some of the
letters we have received from those who have been treated by our
method. We are pledged to <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original">secresy</ins> with our correspondents, however, and
cannot use their names publicly; we cannot publish testimonials,
although we have scores of such a nature as to satisfy the most
incredulous, yet all must understand that it would be a breach of
confidence on our part to make these public, and would
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<span class = "headnote">
Our Crayons are Inserted without Pain.
</span>
ruin our practice besides, as we can only do business of this nature
under guarantee of strict privacy. But of the many hundreds we have
successfully treated, a number have voluntarily given us permission to
refer to them in correspondence with interested parties.</p>

<p>We will cheerfully furnish, on conditions named below, a list of some
of the persons who have taken this mode of treatment, been thoroughly
developed in size and strength of the organs, and relieved of every
trace of seminal disease or weakness, and from gratitude and good hearts
have volunteered to answer any questions addressed to them by interested
persons, who are, of course, expected to hold such correspondence
confidential<ins class = "correction" title = "so in original">,
</ins>Bear in mind that we use these names only by permission, which was
given us unsought by patrons who paid for our services, and now tender
this privilege more through kindness to sufferers than a desire to
benefit us financially. To save these gentlemen annoyance and useless
correspondence, we prefer not to furnish their names except to those who
have had previous correspondence with us and who will accompany the
request with references.</p>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h5>BASHFULNESS AND FALSE MODESTY.</h5>

<p>We are sorry to note in some of our patrons a feeling of shame in
taking this treatment. Such feeling we cannot but regard as absurd, and
the outgrowth of false ideas. If their present condition has been
brought on by evil habits, it is well enough to be ashamed of that fact,
but it is certainly altogether creditable to make use of the first
opportunity to restore or attain a perfectly natural condition and check
such disastrous losses, and in many cases it is absolutely necessary for
the welfare and happiness of themselves and others. A well-known medical
writer says:</p>

<p>
“This treatment does not interfere with any regular habits or
employment, and may be followed without the knowledge or suspicion of
any person whatever. It is beneficial to the general health and quite
pleasant in its effects, giving the person a rejuvenated, buoyant
feeling, infusing new life and manhood; seemingly dashing young strong
blood through all the sluggish veins and arteries of the form.”</p>

<p>
To those who really need this treatment its importance cannot be
overestimated. Each sufferer can answer to himself how very different
life would be if free from his infirmity. Would you not be better
capacitated for business, labor or pleasure? Is not your mind on the
rack often&mdash;perhaps always? Have you not at this time, and in
consequence of this deficiency, a tendency to <ins class = "correction"
title = "so in original">misanthrophy</ins>, a bitter feeling that you
are the victim of an unkind Providence, or else bowed by humiliation due
to your own ignorance or vices? Does not your very incapacity keep your
mind filled with lewd thoughts, which in a state of perfect manhood
would not exist?</p>

<p>
From the confession of hundreds we know how each of you will answer most
or all of these questions.</p>

<p>Is not the means, then, which will raise you above these deplorable
conditions, a blessing inestimable? Is it not an agent of moral as well
as physical regeneration? When this means of deliverance is offered,
will you hesitate in availing yourself of its benefits and making it
known to others who are sufferers like yourself? Let an honest heart and
candid judgment answer for you.</p>

</p>

<h5>THE FALLACY OF CHEAP REMEDIES.</h5>

<p>There are many men who are affected more or less seriously with
Diseases of the Sexual Organs who are constantly on the look-out for
so-called cheap remedies, and in the course of a few years manage to
spend upon these cheap and trashy medicines and appliances twice or
three times as much money as would have been necessary to thoroughly
cure them. And what have they got to show for it?
Nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing, aye, even worse than nothing,
<i>i.e.</i>, positive injury to the organs, for, in nine cases out of
ten, these cheap, clap-trap potions, by over stimulating, imitating and
often inflaming the organs, do them actual harm, hasten and aggravate
the disease and leave the patient in a much worse condition than if he
had taken no treatment at all.</p>

<p>How often have we had cases referred to us for diagnosis and
treatment, where irreparable injury had been done by wrong treatment.
Some were in such a state that no treatment, however excellent, could
possibly help them; in others we have had to labor for months to
eliminate these poisonous medicines from the system and get the Sexual
Organs into proper condition to admit of a restorative treatment; and in
still others the effect of our usually quick and thorough-going remedies
were delayed and interfered with by the ignorance or botchwork of some
quack or bungler, or the well-meant but stupid doctoring of some “family
physician” who thinks himself competent to treat these diseases.</p>

<p>No more delicate, complicated or easily injured or disarranged piece
of mechanism than the Sexual Organs exists. In health, they must be
treated with care and reason&mdash;in disease, with the utmost
circumspection. This branch of medicine, least of all, should be the
parade ground of ignorance, carelessness or false economy. A man’s very
health, life, happiness and vigor, his power to procreate his species,
to perpetuate his name, his ability to make his wife happy and his
children strong and vigorous, all depend upon the treatment he selects.
What is worth doing at all is worth doing well, and he who jeopardizes
health and happiness, present and future, on the mistaken basis of false
economy, is far from wise.</p>

<p>Everything has a value. If a man offers to sell to another a gold
watch worth $150 for $5, you would at once set him down as an impostor,
and the watch as injured or worthless or fraudulent. Yet there are
thousands of men who try to find for a few dollars a remedy for a most
serious and complicated disease. In medicine, as elsewhere, Common Sense
plays an important part. Such remedies cannot possibly do what is
claimed for them. Reputable, honest men, educated and skilled physicians
who have spent thousands of dollars in obtaining a proper medical
education, cannot afford to waste their time for such slight
remuneration. Hence, unscrupulous scoundrels, who have no reputations
either to make or lose, who make most glaring promises in their printed
matter, who are willing to guarantee anything to anybody, infest this
field. They know how great is man’s cupidity, and trade upon it
willingly, caring nothing for the consequences.</p>

<p class = "headnote full">
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
We hold out no False Hopes.
</p>

<h5>OUR REMEDIES ARE RELIABLE AND REASONABLE.</h5>

<p>We not speak thus disparagingly of cheap remedies because ours are
dear, for no patient who has gone the round of cheap remedies, and has
at last profited by Civiale’s method, but will tell you that our
treatment is cheap at any price.</p>

<p>We charge what we consider a fair and reasonable profit on our
remedies. Our entire institution is conducted on the very highest and
most ethical medical basis. The Physicians comprising our Consulting
Staff are men of the best standing, of fine education, and having
special experience in this branch of medical science; our remedies are
made up under the direct personal supervision of one of the most expert
chemists in this country, and precisely after Civiale’s formulæ; our
drugs are purchased from such firms as McKesson &amp; Robbins,
Schieffelin, etc., and are of the purest and best, and our aim at all
times is to give the patient consulting us the full value of his
money.</p>

<p>For such skill and services we charge fairly and reasonably, and we
have yet to find a patient who is dissatisfied. Our cases get well,
provided our advice is followed and a cure is possible. If it is not, we
frankly and candidly tell the truth. We cannot afford to make false
statements or false promises, to hold out hopes we cannot justify, to
ruin our established and well-known reputation for honesty, fair dealing
and medical skill in order to make a few dollars. We find that one man
cured is the very best advertisement we can have, and that one such case
makes us one warm friend and advocate, and brings us many patients,
where one man deceived and defrauded would make us one bitter enemy and
injure us in the eyes of many. Thus, every other consideration of honor
and honesty aside, it pays us better to deal fairly with our
patrons.</p>

<p>This treatment has been thoroughly tried in the most desperate and
adverse cases, and has stood the test of time and repeated trials, has
stood these tests as no other remedy or remedies ever have or ever will,
and in them men of all ages and all conditions may find strength, health
and vigor.</p>

A SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</a></h3>

<h5 class = "sans boldf">STRICT MORALITY vs. FALSE MODESTY.</h5>

<p>In preparing both the first and later editions of this little work
(that has brought happiness to so many by opening the way to knowledge
of a proper means of cure and methods of regaining health and vigor),
<b>the utmost care and circumspection have been exercised in an endeavor
to exclude from its pages anything that could be construed by the most
fastidious as immodest, obscene, or in any way offensive to decency,
morality or good breeding</b>. Indeed, although purely and essentially
<b>a medical work, and intended solely for such persons whose duty it is
to be acquainted with the facts given</b>, in order to understand their
complaint, to place themselves under proper treatment, and to avoid the
dangers of quackery, we have in many instances wholly excluded or
materially modified the wording of passages in order to comply with our
original ideas of the strictest purity of thought and speech
commensurate with a truthful and honest statement of facts.</p>

<p>
We wish it distinctly understood that <b>this treatise is intended
solely for persons suffering from Genito-Urinary Diseases</b>, and that
it is <b>never mailed to any person who has not voluntarily requested us
to send it</b>, and then <b>not to boys</b> or to members of the
<b>opposite sex</b>. (Our application books show a large number of such
refusals.)</p>

<p>
We look upon our special mission in the field of medicine as
<b>distinct</b>, <b>laudable</b> and <b>holy</b>. There are those who
look down upon this special branch of medicine, and some ignoramuses who
assert that such diseases only exist in the imaginations of such
patients as a result of reading the pamphlets of quacks who paint
frightful pictures of insanity, idiocy, etc. To such men as these we
have only this to say: Consult the works of Hammond, Black, Acton,
Wilson, Lallemand, Civialè, Courtenay, Lee etc., etc., the authors of
which have world-wide reputations, not only as physicians, but as
truthful, honest and moral men. They will then see how really grave are
such affections and how needful of aid.</p>

<p>God knows that the misery, despondency and actual organic disease, as
a result of early vices, are prevalent enough even to-day to make a
lover of his fellow men sincerely pity and desire to help them. And we
claim (and every honest man cannot but admit) that it is only by the
<b>widespread dissemination of a knowledge of certain facts</b> to young
and old, especially the former, that such vice and its consequences can
be met and overcome. We are daily spreading such knowledge throughout
the length and breadth of this land, not only warning and advising the
young and cautioning the older, but also pointing out to all such as
need it a perfect and easy means of cure and restoration to health and
vigor.</p>

<p>Our mission is as real, noble and important as that of preaching the
Gospel, and aside from its bearing on the enlightenment of those who
would otherwise go astray, and offering the means of relief to those who
have already sinned against Nature, it is of a broader and even more
sweeping importance. As every whole must needs be the sum total of its
integrals, so <b>each nation</b> and <b>people must</b>&mdash;in mental,
moral and physical traits&mdash;<b>be that which its individual members
make it</b>. Hence, if perfect general health, full procreative ability
and healthy offspring mark the majority of the individuals, so naturally
must the health, vigor, populousness and power of the nation be
accordingly. <b>As secret vice diminishes, public virtue and morality
become greater.</b> Diseases of the Prostate Gland, Urinary Organs and
Sexual Apparatus are as <b>real, as <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original">embarassing</ins></b> and <b>as needful of cure</b> as
those of the lungs, heart, stomach, or any other organ&mdash;indeed,
more important, for the latter only affect the life or health of the
individual immediately concerned, while the former concern not only the
person affected, but his offspring also.</p>

<p>There is no reason why false modesty or pseudo-delicacy should reign
supreme here. If the Almighty had intended these matters to be viewed
and treated in the light which some fanatics and extremists seem to
desire, we would certainly have been created without the power of
procreation entirely. As it is, such organs and such diseases <b>do
exist</b>, are of the greatest (individual and national) importance, and
provided a <b>full knowledge of the causes and consequences of vice and
abuse as related to these parts can be brought vividly and strongly
before the mind of every man, young or old, in a chaste, decent and
strictly professional manner</b>, the result can only be a good one, and
those who deny it are engaged in moral hair-splitting.</p>

<p>We felt that the foregoing remarks were both <b>apropos</b> and
necessary with a view to contradicting some statements recently made
regarding the uselessness and demoralizing effects of everything
concerning this branch of medical practice, and as due ourselves in
distinctly recording our belief and practice in the matter; more
especially to refute the false accusation that special medical treatises
were being scattered broadcast over the land and made to invade the
privacy of homes, and coming into the hands of young boys and
females.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
